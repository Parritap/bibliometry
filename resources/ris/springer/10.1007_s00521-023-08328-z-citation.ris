AB  - The study of consciousness has gained momentum in recent years by the scientific community. In this same sense, the relationship between cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence presents a fundamental theoretical framework in the study of integrated information theory (IIT) as a theory that makes its way into the knowledge of consciousness. However, there are few studies that integrate these topics and a systematic review of the literature is highly pertinent. This paper seeks to identify methods, methodologies or computational solutions using artificial intelligence and cognitive science fundamentals that can provide some kind of solution to the challenges posed by IIT.
