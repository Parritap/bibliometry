TI  - Teaching and learning computer programming using ChatGPT: A rapid review of literature amid the rise of generative AI technologies
JO  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - The emergence of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has sparked investigations into their applications in teaching and learning. In computer programming education, efforts are underway to explore how this tool can enhance instructional practices. Despite the growing literature, there is a lack of synthesis on its use in this field. This rapid review addresses this gap by examining the current literature to outline research trends, assess how it supports teaching and learning processes, and discern the issues that emerge from its application in programming instruction. A total of 107 documents disseminated across 81 distinct sources and authored by 394 contributors were identified. The review adopted a broad and inclusive approach, selecting literature based on relevance to ChatGPT's application in programming education and encompassing studies from diverse settings and methodologies. Results highlight applications such as personalized tutoring, knowledge reinforcement, instructional material creation, source code generation, immediate feedback, and assessment support. However, its use also introduces challenges such as academic dishonesty, ethical dilemmas, diminished critical thinking, overdependence on ChatGPT, and various technical limitations. Considering these findings, a balanced approach to the utilization of ChatGPT in programming education is essential. Implications and recommendations have been provided to guide policymakers, curriculum designers, teachers, and students in harnessing the benefits of this technology while mitigating potential challenges.
