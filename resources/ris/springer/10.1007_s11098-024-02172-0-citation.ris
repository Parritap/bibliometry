AB  - An important module in the Belief-Desire-Intention architecture for artificial agents (which builds on Michael Bratmanâ€™s work in the philosophy of action) focuses on the task of intention reconsideration. The theoretical task is to formulate principles governing when an agent ought to undo a prior committed intention and reopen deliberation. Extant proposals for such a principle, if sufficiently detailed, are either too task-specific or too computationally demanding. I propose that an agent ought to reconsider an intention whenever some incompatible prospect is sufficiently valuable along some dimension that can be assessed at zero or near-zero computational cost.
