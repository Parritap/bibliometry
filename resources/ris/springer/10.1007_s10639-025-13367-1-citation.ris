TI  - Scaffolding self-regulation in project-based programming learning through online collaborative diaries to promote computational thinking
JO  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - Teaching computational thinking skills to novice college students via programming poses considerable challenges. It involves learning programming language syntax and commands, along with fostering higher-order skills crucial for both computational thinking proficiency and future careers. To address this, we proposed a pedagogical approach integrating project-based learning with self-regulated learning in a C programming course. Guided by the higher-order computational thinking framework, this quasi-experimental study enrolled 173 students divided into three groups, a group with project-based learning design alone, a group with both project-based learning design and self-regulated learning scaffolding, and a control group with traditional teacher centered teaching. One-way analysis of covariance results showed the group with both project-based learning design and self-regulated learning scaffolding presented the most advancement of problem-solving and metacognitive skills. Paired samples t-tests showed this group also displayed the most significant improvements in computational thinking tendency and other higher-order skills. While the studentsâ€™ cognitive knowledge gain in the group with both pedagogical supports didn't surpass students of the control group, it did outperform students from the group with project-based learning design alone. Overall, our findings supported the effectiveness of this integrated method in boosting computational thinking and other higher-order skills in novice programming students. This warranted further research to refine and enhance the proposed pedagogical strategy.
