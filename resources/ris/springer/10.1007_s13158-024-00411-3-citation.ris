TI  - Early Coding Education and its Multidimensional Impact on Preschool Development: An Analysis of ChatGPT’s Insights
JO  - International Journal of Early Childhood
AB  - This study investigates ChatGPT’s perspectives on coding education for preschool children to provide a comprehensive understanding that is valuable for educators in early childhood education. An instrumental case study approach was employed, utilizing qualitative research design and case study methods. Data were gathered using a structured interview form containing 93 questions posed to ChatGPT version 3.5 to obtain in-depth insights into coding education during the preschool period. Content analysis examined ChatGPT’s responses, identifying key themes and codes. The findings indicate that coding practices equip children with coding skills and support their development in multiple domains. Furthermore, the study highlights that uncertainties surrounding the definition of coding, the skills it encompasses, and its integration into curricula are gradually diminishing, with more explicit frameworks emerging. While there are drawbacks to artificial intelligence tools, the study concludes that tools like ChatGPT have significant potential to contribute to the content development of teachers, offering valuable resources to enhance coding education in early childhood.
