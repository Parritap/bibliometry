TI  - AI-based chatbot interactions and critical thinking skills: an exploratory study
JO  - Current Psychology
AB  - The widespread adoption of AI-driven chatbots has ushered in a transformative era in human-machine interaction. Notably, systems such as ChatGPT, proficient in furnishing personalized and immediate responses, have markedly elevated user experience and facilitated more seamless and intuitive communication with machines. Nonetheless, the ramifications of this interaction on cognitive processes, particularly on the capacity for intricate critical thinking, remain inadequately explored. This study aimed to investigate the influence of engaging with ChatGPT on the use of complex critical thinking skills within a cohort of Italian users. A total of 126 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires designed to gauge their familiarity and experience with ChatGPT. They also underwent an evaluation of their critical thinking performance using the Critical Reasoning Assessment (CRA). The findings revealed that increased knowledge and experience with ChatGPT, when coupled with cautious use, enhanced critical thinking abilities. These findings underscore the potential of conscientious interaction with ChatGPT as a valuable tool for augmenting usersâ€™ proficiency in critical thinking.
