AB  - This study presents a scoping survey examining the integration of ChatGPT in mathematics education, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and implications for teaching and learning. The survey identifies key themes, including ChatGPT’s ability to assist in understanding mathematical concepts, lesson planning, assessment design, personalized learning, and fostering collaboration. While the tool demonstrates potential in enhancing self-regulated learning, providing real-time feedback, and supporting critical thinking, challenges such as its occasional inaccuracies, ethical concerns, and the risk of over-reliance on AI are also noted. The review emphasizes the importance of human oversight and ethical considerations in leveraging ChatGPT for inclusive and dynamic mathematics education. It concludes that, with thoughtful integration, ChatGPT can serve as a transformative resource, fostering both individualized and collaborative learning experiences while reshaping the learner–tool relationship in educational contexts.
