TI  - Immersive, Task-Based Language Learning Through XR and AI: From Design Thinking to Deployment
JO  - TechTrends
AB  - The integration of design thinking with extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for second language (L2) learning by providing immersive, interactive, and personalized experiences. Despite significant advancements in XR and AI technologies, their practical integration within formal language education remains underexplored. This conceptual paper introduces an innovative “design-to-deployment” framework that combines design thinking with task-based language teaching (TBLT) principles to guide the creation of XR and AI-enhanced learning environments. The model highlights interdisciplinary collaborations among computational designers, software engineers, applied linguists, and instructional designers to integrate XR’s immersive capabilities with AI-driven conversational agents that enable adaptive feedback and authentic language interaction. This study demonstrates how design thinking informs the iterative development of instructional content and immersive XR environments, addressing gaps in the literature related to the practical deployment of immersive technologies in intact classroom settings. The proposed framework emphasizes learner-centered design, facilitating authentic language production, cultural understanding, and personalized learning pathways. By showcasing a structured, research-informed approach to integrating XR and AI, the model provides evidence-based strategies for creating task-based L2 learning experiences that transcend traditional classroom methods. The article further highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in designing and deploying technology-enhanced learning solutions. It lays a foundation for further research on immersive language learning technologies and offers a flexible framework adaptable to diverse educational contexts. Through this approach, the study advances the field of L2 education by demonstrating how theoretical and technological innovations can converge to create impactful, real-world learning experiences.
