JOUR ,,,,,"The digital paradigm requires efficient methods of teaching CAAD tools in architecture schools. With the trend of enhancing the design process with parametric methods, linking architecture with other knowledge areas, such as mathematics, is gaining in importance. Equipping future architects with skills in algorithmic thinking is yet another challenge for education. This paper describes the workflow of an early-stage course addressing this challenge, conducted at the Warsaw University of Technology’s Faculty of Architecture. The course focuses on the students’ ability to construct complex geometric forms in the digital environment by introducing an extensive analytic phase. The students study the geometric foundations of real-world architectural cases and translate them into parametric models. Later, they explore the potential of the generated solutions space. The results compare the course’s teaching efficiency with the outcomes of past courses covering similar subjects.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational design and shape grammars hold a growing appeal in the architectural curricula. This paper aims to assess shape grammars as a visual teaching method that integrates manual exploration based on “learning by doing” in early education curricula without digital software. As a primary outcome of a visual design course at the British university in Egypt, four self-structured pavilions are fabricated by first-year architecture students. Experimentation occurs through a process of visual computing which develops a deeper understanding of material qualities. A comparison of design parameters is conducted through hands-on experiments that include design principles, unit transformations, connection types, assembly process, and functional aspects. The paper examines the skills that students acquired during the course. This study concludes that by applying shape grammars in design studios, students are adequately prepared at the foundational level for their transition towards learning computational design.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper proposes a hybrid design technique for precast panels that incorporates soft-material formwork, computational form-finding, and the Truchet tiling concept. Initial experiments were conducted to investigate how flexible membranes, such as polyester, can create natural tension shapes that rigid molds cannot achieve. Compared to traditional metal and wooden formworks, fabric formwork offers greater sustainability due to its low cost, rapid fabrication, and ease of transport, making it a viable alternative for fabricating Truchet tile-based panels. The panels will be generated using regular polygons with multiple random curves inside, creating infinitely repeatable patterns. To simulate the continuity of the bump deflection, a parametric design script will be developed in conjunction with the concept of medial axis. Ultimately, an efficient and effective method of fabric formwork based on Truchet tiles will serve as a practical reference for future research.

Using Python within Rhino software, students translated architectural formal compositions into algorithmic representations through code writing. The model guided students through steps such as analyzing architectural geometry, creating algorithmic flows, and developing scripts to automatically generate form variations. Challenges arose from students' limited familiarity with Textual Programming Languages (TPLs) and the requisite mathematical knowledge for detailed geometric analyses. Despite initial hurdles, students exhibited genuine algorithmic thinking, successfully creating algorithmic representations of architectural forms. Survey results underscored the model's efficacy in promoting research skills while offering a fresh perspective on architectural form.

JOUR ,,,,,"In recent years, the gastronomy industry has increased the demand for rigorous and reliable tools to evaluate culinary creativity; but conceptually, creativity is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. In this paper, we propose an AI-based method for assessing culinary product creativity by using the renowned high cuisine restaurant elBulli as a case study to understand the proliferation and scale of an entity’s creativity and innovation. To achieve so, we trained a Random Forest Classifier to assess the level of creativity within the restaurant’s recipes. The application of this model to elBulli’s recipes allowed us to answer the following questions: how can creativity in a culinary product be characterized? Is there a single trait that is the key to culinary creativity? Is the creative culinary product a truly original outcome? Our key findings are (1) although ingredients and preparation techniques prove to be suitable attributes to characterize creativity in a recipe, none of them nor an elite subset clearly identifies creative cuisine, (2) new products are not radically novel with respect to previous creations, (3) creativity is more related to new uses and combinations of existing ingredients and techniques rather than to new ingredients or techniques. We believe that our method can find practical applications in supporting and guiding the creation of culinary products, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and helping restaurants maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.

JOUR ,,,,,"Initially coined by Weizenbaum in 1976, ‘alien' thought refers to the radical difference with which ‘thinking machines’ approach the process of thinking. The contemporary paradox of over-determination and indeterminacy—caused largely by algorithmic decision-making in the civic realm—makes these differences both more entangled and more difficult to navigate. In this essay, I trace over-determination to Leibniz and Turing’s axiomatic procedures and to instrumental rationality, and I trace indeterminacy to the mid-twentieth century co-development of computers and neurosciences to advance the following proposition: understanding alien thought requires understanding incomputability, temporal swarming, and inscriptive-significational errance. Understanding these phenomena in turn requires understanding thinking by doing, distributed thinking, and ontological indeterminacy. All are present in machinic operations as well as in the twentieth century experimental artistic practices of artists such as Duchamp, Cage, and Xu. These practices rely on indeterminate procedures and function as diagrammatic machines. A diagrammatic machine is neither abstract nor particular; neither an idea that is determining in the supreme instance, nor an infrastructure that is determining in the last instance, but rather instantiates a real yet to come (Deleuze and Guattari in A thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia: Trans. Massumi B, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1987). In this essay, indeterminate artistic practices are used as an entry into alien thought and its correlates—infinity and complexity—by way of aesthetic analogy.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the face of massively increased technological complexity, it is striking that so many of today’s computational and networked things follow design ideals honed decades ago in a much different context. These strong ideals prescribe a presentation of things as useful tools through design and a withdrawal of aspects of their functionality and complexity. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, we trace this ‘withdrawal program’ as it has persisted in the face of increasing computational complexity. Currently, design is in a dilemma where computational products can be seen as brilliantly designed and engaging to use yet can also be considered very problematic in how they support hidden agendas and often seem less than trustworthy. In this article, we analyse factors shaping this emergent ethical dilemma and reveal the concept of a widening rift between what computational things actually are and do and the ways in which they are presented as things for use. Against this backdrop, we argue that there is a need for a new orientation in design programs to adequately address this deepening rupture between the aesthetics and ethics in the design of computational things.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article examines the connecting lines between the Chilean Project Cybersyn’s interface design, the German Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm and its cybernetically inspired approaches towards information design, and later developments in interaction design and the emerging field of Human–Computer Interaction in the USA. In particular, it first examines how early works of designers Tomàs Maldonado and Gui Bonsiepe on operative communication, that is, language-independent (and thus internationalizable) pictogram systems and visual grammars for computational systems, were intertwined with attempts to ground industrial design in a scientific methodology, to address an era of computing machines, and to develop the concept of the interface as a heuristic for a renovated design thinking. It thereby also reconstructs further historical vanishing lines—e.g. the pictorial grammar of Otto Neurath’s ISOTYPE—of the development of the ‘ulm model’ of design. Second, the article explores how an apprehension of first-order cybernetics in West Germany—e.g. represented by hfg ulm staff like Max Bense or Abraham Moles, merged with Cybersyn’s second-order cybernetics ideas, as represented by Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model. And third, it asks about a further conceptual turn regarding an understanding of design which resulted in a focus on communicative interaction, e.g. in the later works of Fernando Flores and Terry Winograd on HCI, or in Beer’s Team Syntegrity approach. As an effect, the text will explore a specific and international network of cybernetic thinking between Latin America, Europe, and North America which emerged around Project Cybersyn, and which was occupied with questions of HCI, a democratization of design, and intelligence amplification.

JOUR ,,,,,"Algorithmic systems that provide services to people by supporting or replacing human decision-making promise greater convenience in various areas. The opacity of these applications, however, means that it is not clear how much they truly serve their users. A promising way to address the issue of possible undesired biases consists in giving users control by letting them configure a system and aligning its performance with users’ own preferences. However, as the present paper argues, this form of control over an algorithmic system demands an algorithmic literacy that also entails a certain way of making oneself knowable: users must interrogate their own dispositions and see how these can be formalized such that they can be translated into the algorithmic system. This may, however, extend already existing practices through which people are monitored and probed and means that exerting such control requires users to direct a computational mode of thinking at themselves.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper seeks to bypass assumptions that researchers in critical algorithmic studies and urban studies find it difficult to study algorithmic systems due to their black-boxed nature. In addition, it seeks to work against the assumption that advocating for transparency in algorithms is, therefore, the key for achieving an enhanced understanding of the role of algorithmic technologies on modern life. Drawing on applied assemblage thinking via the concept of the urban assemblage, I demonstrate how the notion of urban assemblage can work as an alternative way to explore the distributed and potential dimensions of what has been termed as Urban AI phenomena. Rather than seeing Urban AI phenomena as black-boxed, unknown and opaque, the notion of urban assemblage locates such entities within the wider contests of the city: urban places, communities and politics, where human-algorithmic relationships gather and disperse. In addition, this approach focuses on the potentialities of Urban AI phenomena—how algorithmic systems can operate differently through different aspects of the city—which can be seen to manifest new forms of resistance, collective actions and democracy. I use a case study of an algorithmic system designed to facilitate digital democracy—vTaiwan—to exemplify how assemblage methodology foregrounds the role of cities as spaces and places for exploring the democratic possibilities of algorithmic systems. This paper concludes with discussion of how the assemblage methodology contributes to serve as a bridge between critical algorithm studies and recent studies of platform urbanism.

JOUR ,,,,,"The foundations of AI design discourse are worth analyzing. Here, attention is paid to the nature of theory languages used in designing new AI technologies because the limits of these languages can clarify some fundamental questions in the development of AI. We discuss three types of theory language used in designing AI products: formal, computational, and natural. Formal languages, such as mathematics, logic, and programming languages, have fixed meanings and no actual-world semantics. They are context- and practically content-free. Computational languages use terms referring to the actual world, i.e., to entities, events, and thoughts. Thus, computational languages have actual-world references and semantics. They are thus no longer context- or content-free. However, computational languages always have fixed meanings and, for this reason, limited domains of reference. Finally, unlike formal and computational languages, natural languages are creative, dynamic, and productive. Consequently, they can refer to an unlimited number of objects and their attributes in an unlimited number of domains. The differences between the three theory languages enable us to reflect on the traditional problems of strong and weak AI.

If we think of AI as computational artifacts, then values and AI cannot be added together because they are ontologically distinct. If we think of AI as sociotechnical systems, then components of values and AI are in the same ontologic category—they are both social. However, even here thinking about the relationship as one of ‘embedding’ is a mischaracterization. The relationship between values and AI is best understood as a dimension of the relationship between technology and society, a relationship that can be theorized in multiple ways. The literature in this area is consistent in showing that technology and society are co-productive. Within the co-production framework, the relationship between values and AI is shown to be generative of new meaning. This stands in stark contrast to the framework of ‘embedding’ values which frames values as fixed things that can be inserted into technological artifacts.

It argues that: (i) the former offers a way to reveal the cultural constitution of and enactment of human + machine cognition and, in the process, the limitations of the computational and connectionist assumptions about learning that underpin, respectively, good old-fashioned AI and deep learning; and (2) the latter offers a way to identify, when amplified with insights from Socio-Materialism and Cultural-Historical Activity Theory, how ML is further rearranging and reorganising the distributed basis of cognition in assistive assemblages.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study challenges the conventional boundaries of philosophy by asserting that organizations can function as legitimate subjects within philosophical discourse. Western philosophy, epitomized by Descartes, has long assumed that individual human beings are the fundamental units of thought and moral agency. However, in a significant oversight, this belief overlooks the idea that organizations can think independently, leading to both virtuous and malevolent results. Epistemology lacks a clear prioritization of morally sound knowledge over potentially harmful knowledge. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has also transformed the landscape of cognition from a primarily individual human endeavor into a joint undertaking where humans collaborate with AI entities in collective thinking and decision-making. Nevertheless, AI lacks the innate ability to discern between ethical and unethical actions. This symbiosis creates organizations as fundamental philosophical subjects, marking a significant shift in philosophical emphasis where the organization takes the center stage. Accordingly, within this emerging field, we advance four propositions as the core subjects of organization philosophy: organizations can think, organizations can create knowledge, AI can be part of an organization, and humans in the organization control moral discipline. These propositions guide the ethical coexistence of AI and human agents in organizations, emphasizing the importance of ethical deliberation in knowledge use. Moreover, the malicious use of profound knowledge hinders human progress, as illustrated in this study by an ethical examination of military institutions within organization philosophy.

JOUR ,,,,,"In 1980, the 85 year-old mystic and thinker Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986), having been introduced to the subject of artificial intelligence by computer scientists, became engrossed in the challenge posed to the human mind by the prospect of the machine taking over its processes and faculties. What makes Krishnamurti’s angle worthy of separate discussion is that it accentuates not social and cultural ramifications, but a mostly overlooked potential philosophical and psychological crisis. As a thinker and mystic whose life work entirely centred on the transformation of the human mind, Krishnamurti worried that an insufficiently cultivated mind that had been employed merely for material and mechanical purposes would be perfectly imitable and thus replaceable by computers and other machines. Thus, our main concern should not be machines attaining humanlike minds, but people having machinelike minds. I argue that the particular dimension of the AI–mind encounter elucidated by Krishnamurti can significantly broaden the field of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Firstly, Krishnamurti’s investigation further problematizes the field by handing us the question: ‘If the machine can take over everything man can do, and do it still better than us, then what is a human being?’ Accordingly, he demonstrates, deploying phenomenological observations, various ways in which human thought is worryingly computational and machinelike. Secondly, since Krishnamurti’s approach is transformative and arguably soteriological, he offers intriguing ways in which we could consider the inherently nonmechanical yet unactualized faculties of the mind. Since Krishnamurti’s observations involve an insight into the present condition of the mind and a potential active response to this condition, they have some pertinence to both the primary discourse in the field – the interrelations between artificial intelligence and aspects of human cognition – and the emerging discussion of meaningfulness in life in the face of AI.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this paper, I reflect on the puzzle that machine learning presents to social theory to develop an account of its distinct impact on social reality.   I start by presenting how machine learning has presented a challenge to social theory as a research subject comprising both familiar and alien characteristics (1.). Taking this as an occasion for theoretical inquiry, I then propose a conceptual framework to investigate how algorithmic models of social phenomena relate to social reality and what their stochastic mode of operation entails in terms of their sociality (2.). Analyzed through a theoretical lens that relies on central tenets of sociological systems theory, I find that machine learning implies a distinct epistemic transformation, based on how algorithmic modeling techniques process meaning as represented in data embedded in vector space. Building on this characterization, I introduce my conceptualization of stochastic technology as distinct from mechanistic technologies that rely on causal fixation (3.). Based on this understanding, I suggest that real-world applications of machine learning are often characterized by a constitutive tension between the stochastic properties of their outputs and the ways in which they are put to use in practice. Focussing on the large language models LaMDA and ChatGPT, I examine the epistemological implications of LLMs to account for the confusion of correlation and causality as the root of this tension. Next, I illustrate my theoretical conception by way of discussing an essay on image models by German media artist Hito Steyerl (4.).  Following a critical reflection on Steyerl's characterization of Stable Diffusion as a “white box ”, I finally propose to conceive ofmachine learning-based technologies as stochastic contingency machines that transform social indeterminacy into contingent observations of social phenomena (5.) In this perspective, machine learning constitutes an epistemic technology that operates on meaning as extractable from data by means of algorithmic data modeling techniques to produce stochastic accounts of social reality.

By examining the technicity of Galactica, it is possible to explain the descripancies between its promotional corporate discourse and abysmal outputs. Second, by going back to debates in both computer science and computational philosophy on the automation of abduction, we argue from the epistemological front that LLMs indeed cannot produce strong abductions and, therefore, claims about the automation of hypothesis generation remains chambering. Finally, our third argument is a sociological one. By conceptualizing the scientific field through Nancy Katherine Hayles’ cognitive assemblage theory, we aim to outline the potential steering of science by LLMs, mainly through information ordering. The core of our argument rests on the assertion that excessive control on information risks contravening a certain serendipitous aspect inherent to scientific discoveries.

JOUR ,,,,,"The proliferation of AI systems across all domains of life as well as the complexification and opacity of algorithmic techniques, epitomised by the bourgeoning field of Deep Learning (DL), call for new methods in the Humanities for reflecting on the techno-human relation in a way that places the technical operation at its core. Grounded on the work of the philosopher of technology Gilbert Simondon, this paper puts forward individuation theory as a valuable approach to reflect on contemporary information technologies, offering an analysis of the functioning of deep neural networks (DNNs), a type of data-driven computational models at the core of major breakthroughs in AI. The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to demonstrate how a joint reading of Simondon’s mechanology and individuation theory, foregrounded in the Simondonian concept of information, can cast new light on contemporary algorithmic techniques by considering their situated emergence as opposed to technical lineage; (2) to suspend a predictive framing of AI systems, particularly DL techniques, so as to probe into their technical operation, accounting for the data-driven individuation of these models and the integration of potentials as functionality; and finally, (3) to argue that individuation theory might in fact de-individuate AI, in the sense of disassembling the already-there, the constituted, paving the way for questioning the potentialities for data and their algorithmic relationality to articulate the unfolding of everyday life.

JOUR ,,,,,"Science is being transformed by the increasing capabilities of automation technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating AI and machine learning (ML) into scientific practice requires changing established research methods while maintaining a scientific understanding of research findings. Researchers are at the forefront of this change, but there is currently little understanding of how they are experiencing these upheavals in scientific practice. In this paper, we examine how researchers working in several research fields (automation engineering, computational design, conservation decision-making, materials science, and synthetic biology) perceive AI/ML technologies used in their work, such as laboratory automation, automated design of experiments, computational design, and computer experiments. We find that researchers emphasised the need for AI/ML technologies to have practical benefits (such as efficiency and improved safety) to justify their use. Researchers were also hesitant to automate data analysis, and the importance of explainability differed between researchers working with laboratory automation and those using AI/ML directly in their research. This difference is due to the different role AI/ML plays in different research fields: laboratory automation performs processes already defined by the researcher and the actions are visible or recorded, while in AI/ML applications the decisions that produced the result may be obscure to the researcher. Understanding the role AI/ML plays in scientific practice is important for ensuring that scientific knowledge continues to grow. ",,,"Douglas, David M.

Representing the diverse audiences they serve is a key objective for libraries and archives. For example, institutions with colonial-era archival documents are experimenting with AI to improve the discoverability of their collections and to enhance access for source communities and other users. Indeed, AI can be used to automatically create metadata, search vast amounts of historical records, and answer questions with natural language. However, these technologies also come with risks—for instance when AI systems are trained on potentially biased data. Very little is known about the impact of these computational tools on diversity in archival collections. Do AI technologies compound or alleviate the lack of diversity in archives? Drawing from interviews with academics, archivists, curators, and other experts across the UK/Europe and the USA, this article sheds light on the lack of collaboration between producers of AI technologies on the one side, and archivists, librarians and other cultural heritage professionals on the other side. We argue that bringing these stakeholders together is essential to improve the diversity of archival collections, using ethical and responsible AI.

JOUR ,,,,,"From a 4E cognition framework, this article compares earlier cultural and technologically mediated expert practices with contemporary use of digital technology. I discuss two case studies. First, the art of memory, where I look at how medieval monks constructed memory palaces inside their minds to enable creative thinking and how Renaissance thinker Giulio Camillo built on this tradition to create a complex machine to think. The second example is of literary writing, where I look at how writers engage with the materiality of language and the writing material, creating new cognitive opportunities. Finally, I compare these earlier practices with contemporary digital technology, discussing both continuous and novel aspects. First, I examine how all practices engineer the cognitive surroundings of its practitioners to enable new cognitive possibilities. However, this comparative work also allows me to spot a worrisome novelty in digital technology. In many cases, the goals of such technology are contrary to those of its users. Drawing on discussions both outside and inside the 4E framework, I argue that digital technology introduces economic agency into our minds. I suggest that when we extend our minds in the digital ecology, we allow powerful economic actors to shape the direction of our cognitive lives in ways that are contrary to our own goals. Finally, I argue, building on the case studies, that my discussion might point to a new and more pragmatic approach to these issues.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper develops a critical theory of artificial intelligence, within a historical constellation where computational systems increasingly generate cultural content that destabilises traditional distinctions between human and machine production. Through this analysis, I introduce the concept of the algorithmic condition, a cultural moment when machine-generated work not only becomes indistinguishable from human creation but actively reshapes our understanding of ideas of authenticity. This transformation, I argue, moves beyond false consciousness towards what I call post-consciousness, where the boundaries between individual and synthetic consciousness become porous. Drawing on critical theory and extending recent work on computational ideology, I develop three key theoretical contributions, first, the concept of the Inversion to describe a new computational turn in algorithmic society; second, automimetric production as a framework for understanding emerging practices of automated value creation; and third, constellational analysis as a methodological approach for mapping the complex interplay of technical systems, cultural forms and political economic structures. Through these contributions, I argue that we need new critical methods capable of addressing both the technical specificity of AI systems and their role in restructuring forms of life under computational capitalism. The paper concludes by suggesting that critical reflexivity is needed to engage with the algorithmic condition without being subsumed by it and that it represents a growing challenge for contemporary critical theory.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper broadens Scott Rettberg and Jill Walker Rettberg’s concept of Algorithmic Narrativity, which explores the evolving dynamics of narrativity at the intersection of human creativity and computational capabilities. It traces the technological and historical development of algorithmic narratives, from the early computational story composition (CSC) systems or story generator algorithms (SGAs) to the advanced generative AI models now capable of creating more compelling and contextually grounded narratives. It situates algorithmic narratives within the broader cultural imaginaries of AI and algorithms, exploring the anxieties and narratives that frame them, especially the challenges of technological incursions into literary and cultural domains. By distinguishing between AI narratives, algorithmically generated narratives and algorithmic narratives, the paper outlines their intersection and unique characterizations. It identifies the manifestations of algorithmic narratives, examines their dynamics and potential to redefine creativity and authorship, and enhance digital narratives by enabling regenerative narrativity that transcends existing narrative modes. Also, it examines the ethical implications and concerns that arise from the emergence of algorithmic narrativity. In essence, the paper contends that algorithmic narrativity offer both critical and creative lens to interrogate the evolving interaction between humans and (modern) AI technologies, as well as calling for new frameworks and methodologies to comprehend these transformative narrative modes, aesthetically and ethically.

Irreproducibility of biological and multi-omics research results from different laboratories, platforms, and analysis methods is hampering the translation of research into clinical uses and can often be attributed to the lack of biologists’ attention to the general principles of metrology. In this paper, the progresses of biometrology including metrology on nucleic acid, protein, and cell measurements and its impacts on the improvement of reliability and comparability in biological research are reviewed. Challenges in obtaining more reliable biological and multi-omics measurements due to the lack of primary reference measurement procedures and new standards for biological reference materials faced by biometrology are discussed. In the future, in addition to establishing reliable reference measurement procedures, developing reference materials from single or multiple parameters to multi-omics scale should be emphasized.

JOUR ,,,,,"Cosmetic surgery is ever more affordable and accessible, but carries physical and psychological risks. Yet, no study to date has directly examined risk-taking behaviour under controlled conditions, beyond self-report and in relation to cosmetic surgery attitudes. We used the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and advanced computational modelling to measure decision-making behaviour and identify the latent parameters driving behaviour associated with cosmetic surgery attitudes in women with no cosmetic surgery history (N = 265) and a subsample of women with a cosmetic surgery history (N = 24). Risk taking was higher in women with greater acceptance and history of cosmetic surgery. Computational modelling revealed increased risk taking in women with greater acceptance of cosmetic surgery when decisions were made with greater knowledge of loss (risk) and not when the likelihood of loss was unknown (uncertainty). When women with greater acceptance of cosmetic surgery made decisions, they also placed less emphasis on possible losses (reduced loss aversion). Our findings suggest that women seeking cosmetic procedures may be less sensitive to losses and thus make more risky decisions. Greater emphasis should be placed on communicating potential losses rather than just the associated risks to women considering cosmetic procedures.

JOUR ,,,,,"In today’s ever-evolving scientific landscape, invasion science faces a plethora of challenges, such as terminological inconsistency and the rapidly growing literature corpus with few or incomplete syntheses of knowledge, which may be perceived as a stagnation in scientific progress. We explore the concept of ‘competency’, which is extensively debated across disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, and linguistics. Traditionally, it is associated with attributes that enable superior performance and continuous ingenuity. We propose that the concept of competency can be applied to invasion science as the ability to creatively and critically engage with global challenges. For example, competency may help develop innovative strategies for understanding and managing the multifaceted, unprecedented challenges posed by the spread and impacts of non-native species, as well as identifying novel avenues of inquiry for management. Despite notable advancements and the exponential increase in scholarly publications, invasion science still encounters obstacles such as insufficient interdisciplinary collaboration paralleled by a lack of groundbreaking or actionable scientific advancements. To enhance competency in invasion science, a paradigm shift is needed. This shift entails fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, nurturing creative and critical thinking, and establishing a stable and supportive environment for early career researchers, thereby promoting the emergence of competency and innovation. Embracing perspectives from practitioners and decision makers, alongside diverse disciplines beyond traditional ecological frameworks, can further add novel insights and innovative methodologies into invasion science. Invasion science must also address the ethical implications of its practices and engage the public in awareness and education programs. Such initiatives can encourage a more holistic understanding of invasions, attracting and cultivating competent minds capable of thinking beyond conventional paradigms and contributing to the advancement of the field in a rapidly changing world.

We consider a large interacting agent system and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker–Planck equation and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterized by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solution mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system toward a declustered state.

We used the new Test of Estimation Strategies (TES), composed of 20 arithmetic problems (e.g., 144 x 0.38), to investigate variability in strategy use in young adults. The TES targets the five estimation strategies that adults use most frequently, which fall into two Classes. The three Class One strategies are general-purpose and taught in schools. Proceed Algorithmically entails applying an algorithm (e.g., shifting a decimal place). Round One and Round Two are defined as rounding one or both operands, respectively. The two Class Two strategies are more advanced, requiring application of conceptual knowledge of mathematics. Known-and-Nice is used when a participant relies on a well-known mathematical fact (e.g., 25 × 4 = 100) to form an estimate. Fractions uses a fraction or percentage in the estimation process (e.g., 943 x 0.48 is about 50% or half of 900). We divided our sample of adult participants into two groups (i.e., high, average) based on their estimation performance on the TES. The high-performance group used a broader range of strategies and more frequently applied the most relevant strategy given a problem’s features. Overall estimation accuracy was correlated with mathematical achievement, as were strategy breadth and strategy relevance. However, none of these associations survived first controlling for verbal achievement. Participants’ strategy reports suggested that the TES problems were generally successful in eliciting the five target strategies and provided evidence for a new strategy, Partitioning.

Similarly, machine learning methods also form inertial thinking schemes through learning the knowledge from a large amount of data. However, when the testing samples are vastly different, the formed inertial thinking schemes will inevitably generate errors. This kind of inertial thinking is called illusion inertial thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"With the rise in popularity of vehicular communication in the modern period, vehicles not only provide convenience for people’s movement, but also create traffic congestion. Urban rail transit plays an increasingly important role in modern urban public transport. To alleviate traffic congestion, a novel intelligent transportation approach has been developed, allowing the intelligent computing technology to be applied to the city’s traffic signal management system, which is critical to solving the city’s traffic problem. The goal of this study is to optimize the signal management system of urban traffic in order to reduce economic losses caused by traffic congestion, such as pollution and energy loss, relieve traffic congestion, and increase traffic efficiency. This paper first describes the existing traffic situation before highlighting the critical role of intelligent computing in urban traffic signal regulation. It then covers fuzzy control, fuzzy neural networks, traffic flow, queuing theory, and car following theory in general. The fuzzy control system for an urban intersection is then presented, the green light phase and red light phase modules are evaluated, and the fuzzy control method is introduced into the traffic signal control system research. The software for controlling the urban traffic trunk line with a fuzzy neural network system is then detailed, and a robust optimization model is constructed. Finally, to prove the superiority of intelligent calculation approach adopted by this study, a specific case study is provided which is coupled with the robust optimization model for comparison. The experimental results of this paper show that the robust optimized-cellular transportation approach of this study is stable, can successfully manage vehicle delays, and increase traffic efficiency.

JOUR ,,,,,"Acceptance sampling plans (ASPs) are conducted by inspecting a small set of items instead of all outputs. Although traditional ASPs use certain plan parameters, it is clear that quality characteristics or definitions may not be certain in some real case applications because of uncertainties. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is a popular technique to model uncertainty in the engineering problems. It is known that ASPs have been successfully formulated based on FST in the literature. However, the uncertainty is generally more complex in cases including human evaluations. Neutrosophic sets (NSs) that is one of the fuzzy set extensions bring some advantages to manage more complicated uncertainties in quality problems especially uncertainty based on human’s hesitancy. Since the NSs include three terms as truthiness (t), indeterminacy (i), and falsity (f), they can successfully model the human thinking and inspectors’ evaluations under uncertainty. In this paper, traditional attribute ASPs have been extended based on interval NSs to combine the computational and interpretational advantages of the interval statistics with the advantages of NSs. Additionally, two well-known distributions for ASPs called Binomial and Poisson distributions are redesigned by using NSs. For this aim, NSs are converted to interval NSs by using α-cut technique and some characteristic functions of ASPs such as acceptance probability ($${P}_{a}$$), average sample number ($$ASN$$), and average total inspection ($$ATI$$) have been designed for single and double ASPs based on interval NSs. The proposed ASPs based on NSs have been tested on some numerical applications from a manufacturing process, and results obtained based on real cases have been compared.

JOUR ,,,,,"Decision-making is crucial in fully autonomous vehicle operations and is expected to greatly influence future transportation systems. Observing the current driving status of autonomous vehicles is vital for its decision-making process. The autonomous connected vehicles on the road send significant data about their movements to the server to maintain continuous training. With the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus process, blockchain technology provides a valid, decentralised and secure option to improve transactions throughput and minimise delay. The limited computational capacity of vehicles poses a challenge in achieving high accuracy and low latency while training self-driving algorithms. GPT-4V surpassed challenging autonomous systems in scene interpretation and causal thinking. GPT-4V has ability to navigate circumstances without access to database, interpret intentions, and make sound decisions in real-world driving scenarios. The reward function and different driving conditions are organised to allow an optimal search to find the most efficient driving style while ensuring safety. The consequences of the Blockchain-enabled decision-making model (DMM) for Self-Driving Vehicles (SDV) primarily based on GPT-4V and Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) would, likely, upgrades in decision-making accuracy, operational performance, statistics integrity, and potentially enhanced learning skills in SDV. Integrating blockchain technology, superior language modelling GPT-4V and FRL may lead to multiplied safety, reliability, and decision-making ability in SDV. This study utilised the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator to assess the ability of SDV to maintain its desired speed consistently and securely in a highway setting using proposed DMM. This study indicates that the suggested DMM, utilising the driving state evaluation approach for SDV, can help these vehicles operate safely and effectively. The performance of the proposed model, such as CPU utilisation, bandwidth and latency, are evaluated through multiple tests.

JOUR ,,,,,"Peptides are currently the most promising lead molecules. Quorum sensing peptides have a variety of structural features and are regularly exposed to post-translational modifications. Antiparkinsonian drugs lose their efficacy after a long period of use, and patients develop motor problems such as drug-induced dyskinesia (DIDs). The interaction between PDE10A and cAMP is necessary for dopamine neurotransmission and may play a role in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. cAMP and cGMP are cyclic nucleotides that act as secondary messengers in the signal transduction pathway, influencing a range of CNS activities. PDE enzymes hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds to break down cAMP and cGMP, allowing them to control intracellular levels of these second messengers effectively. PDE expression, and hence cyclic nucleotide levels and their downstream targets, may change with age and in numerous age-related illnesses, including Parkinson’s disease, according to mounting evidence. At the peak of dyskinesias, cyclic nucleotide levels were lower, and using phosphodiesterase inhibitors before antiparkinsonian medicines reduced the severity of dyskinesias. In a recent study, PapRIV was found to have the ability to activate BV-2 microglia cells, indicating that this quorum sensing peptide may play a role in gut-brain contact. As a result of the current in silico work, mainly focused on QSPs as a lead molecule for inhibiting PDE10A, the SRNAT QSP sequence has been a potent molecule in molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we can test the efficiency of therapeutic components in vitro and in vivo utilizing this computational approach against PDE10A.

Guided by general systems theory and socio-technical thinking, the concept of an information systems artifact directed this review. Our first objective was to clarify the essential subsystems, identifying 23 constituent components of PAS. Subsequently, we delved into the meta-level design of PAS, emphasizing the synergy and delegation between the human decision-maker and prescriptive analytics in supporting organizational decisions. From this exploration, four distinct system archetypes emerged: advisory, executive, adaptive, and self-governing PAS. Lastly, we engaged with affordance theory, illuminating the action potential of PAS. Our study advances the perspective on PAS, specifically from a broader socio-technical and information systems viewpoint, highlighting six distinct research directions, acting as a launchpad for future research in the domain.

JOUR ,,,,,"One objective of neuroscience is to understand a wide range of specific cognitive processes in terms of neuron activity. The huge amount of observational data about the brain makes achieving this objective challenging. Different models on different levels of detail provide some insight, but the relationship between models on different levels is not clear. Complex computing systems with trillions of components like transistors are fully understood in the sense that system features can be precisely related to transistor activity. Such understanding could not involve a designer simultaneously thinking about the ongoing activity of all the components active in the course of carrying out some system feature. Brain modeling approaches like dynamical systems are inadequate to support understanding of computing systems, because their use relies on approximations like treating all components as more or less identical. Understanding computing systems needs a much more sophisticated use of approximation, involving creation of hierarchies of description in which the higher levels are more approximate, with effective translation between different levels in the hierarchy made possible by using the same general types of information processes on every level. These types are instruction and data read/write. There are no direct resemblances between computers and brains, but natural selection pressures have resulted in brain resources being organized into modular hierarchies and in the existence of two general types of information processes called condition definition/detection and behavioral recommendation. As a result, it is possible to create hierarchies of description linking cognitive phenomena to neuron activity, analogous with but qualitatively different from the hierarchies of description used to understand computing systems. An intuitively satisfying understanding of cognitive processes in terms of more detailed brain activity is then possible. ",,,"Coward, L.

Conventional methods are time consuming and prone to human error in detecting diseased areas. Therefore, automatic detection of diseased regions in plant images obtained from imaging devices is becoming increasingly important in modern agriculture. In this study, a novel deep learning-based model called Plant Diseased Region Detection Segmentation Network (PDRDSegNet) is proposed to solve the problem of segmenting diseased regions in plant leaves. PDRDSegNet was developed as a semantic segmentation model specifically optimized for plant disease detection. The performance of the model was compared with common segmentation models such as UNet, SegNet, FCN8, DeepLabV3+, ENet, PSPNet and ICNet. The training and testing of PDRDSegNet and other models were performed using the “Leaf Disease Segmentation Dataset,” which is widely used in agriculture. The results show that PDRDSegNet achieved the highest score with an mIoU accuracy of 86.05%. In addition, PDRDSegNet was found to achieve higher accuracy rates with fewer parameters, optimizing computational costs. These results indicate that PDRDSegNet can be an effective tool for plant disease detection.

The research concludes that the weighted average of the cosine-similarity coefficients derived from independent word embeddings in a double vector space tends to yield high correlations with human judgements.

Next, we explore the mainstream deep learning technologies in chatbot design from the perspective of computational methods and usages. Then, we propose a new framework to classify chatbot construction architectures and differentiate the traditional retrieval-based and generation-based chatbots in terms of the modern pipeline and end-to-end structures. Finally, we highlight future research directions for business chatbots to enable researchers to devote their efforts to the most promising research topics and commercial scenarios and for practitioners to benefit from realizing the trend in business chatbot development and applications.

JOUR ,,,,,"Recent advances in human-in-the-loop or human-centric research have sparked a new wave of scientific exploration. These studies have enhanced the understanding of complex social systems and contributed to more sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems. However, the incorporation of human or social factors increases system complexity, making traditional approaches inadequate for managing these complex systems and necessitating a novel operational paradigm. Over decades of work, a mature and comprehensive theory of parallel intelligence (PI) has been established. Rooted in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), PI adapts flexibly to various situations within complex systems through the ACP framework (Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution), ensuring system reliability. This paper provides a detailed review and a novel perspective on PI, beginning with the historical and philosophical origins of CPSS and proceeding to present both the fundamental framework and technological implementations of PI. PI-based Industry 5.0 is highlighted, where three pillars are adopted to help realize the supposed vision. Additionally, the paper outlines applications of PI in multiple fields, such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture, and discusses the opportunities and challenges for imaginative intelligence. The continuous exploration of PI is expected to eventually facilitate the realization of “6S”-based (safe, secure, sustainable, sensitive, service, and smart) parallel ecosystems.

JOUR ,,,,,"Skin diseases are numerous in types and high in incidence, posing a serious threat to human health. Accurately assessing the severity of skin diseases helps dermatologists in making personalized treatment decisions. However, focusing solely on the skin lesion itself and ignoring the true state of the surrounding skin can lead to distorted results. Assessing the severity of the condition should be a holistic process. Specifically, dermatologists need to compare the abnormal skin with surrounding skin to conduct the diagnosis. To imitate such diagnosis practice of dermatologists, we propose LSATrans, a Transformer based framework customized for severity scoring of skin diseases. Different from the Standard Self-Attention module, we propose the Lesion-aware Self-Attention (LSA) module. LSA can capture the visual features of both lesion and normal surrounding skin areas and include their relationship in modeling. In addition to LSA, the proposed LSATrans also introduces a contrastive learning strategy for further optimization. We first evaluated the performance of LSATrans in scar, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis scoring tasks, and it achieved mean absolute errors of 0.5895, 0.5614, and 0.5416 respectively in these three tasks. Furthermore, we conducted additional validation of LSATrans’s performance in two distinct skin disease diagnosis tasks, where it demonstrated remarkable outcomes with AUCs of 0.9774 and 0.9801, respectively, in the classification of common skin diseases and subtypes of skin diseases. These results are better than existing methods, indicating that LSATrans is expected to become a universal, accurate and objective intelligent tool for scoring the severity of skin diseases.

JOUR ,,,,,"Neuroinformatics involves replicating and detecting intricate brain activities through computational models, where deep learning plays a foundational role. Our systematic review explores quantum deep learning (QDL), an emerging deep learning sub-field, to assess whether quantum-based approaches outperform classical approaches in brain data learning tasks. This review is a pioneering effort to compare these deep learning domains. In addition, we survey neuroinformatics and its various subdomains to understand the current state of the field and where QDL stands relative to recent advancements. Our statistical analysis of tumor classification studies (n = 16) reveals that QDL models achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9701 (95% CI 0.9533–0.9868), slightly outperforming classical models with a mean accuracy of 0.9650 (95% CI 0.9475–0.9825). We observed similar trends across Alzheimer’s diagnosis, stroke lesion detection, cognitive state monitoring, and brain age prediction, with QDL demonstrating better performance in metrics such as F1-score, dice coefficient, and RMSE. Our findings, paired with prior documented quantum advantages, highlight QDL’s promise in healthcare applications as quantum technology evolves. Our discussion outlines existing research gaps with the intent of encouraging further investigation in this developing field.

JOUR ,,,,,"Due to the new normal caused by the pandemic, consumer behaviour has now shifted to online shopping not only for general commodities but also for food and other perishable products. Therefore, e-commerce fulfilment is now integrated with cold chain capabilities to satisfy stringent requirements on time-criticality and product quality, leading to the concept of cold chain e-fulfilment. In the cold chain e-fulfilment process, perishable orders are packed in thermal packaging solutions and delivered to consumers before the quality preservation time window. To secure a sufficient time buffer during last mile delivery, excessive use of thermal packaging materials is applied, which creates an adverse environmental impact on our eco-system. Aligning with low-carbon business practices, this study proposes a novel joint optimization model, namely the Joint Optimization of Sustainable Order Packing and Multi-Temperature Delivery Problem (JOSOPMDP), for order packing and vehicle routing decisions, where the sustainable use of thermal packaging materials is promoted without negatively influencing product quality and customer satisfaction. To evaluate its viability and performance, three sets of computational experiments are subsequently conducted. It is found that the proposed model is feasible to strike a balance between order packing and vehicle routing decisions. Compared with the traditional strategy, the average total cost and satisfaction level are improved by 3.26% and 47.88%, respectively. Consequently, this research fosters sustainable thinking in the cold chain e-fulfilment process, minimizing environmental impact. ",,,"Lee, C. K. M.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper presents a comprehensive model for representing and reasoning on situations to support decision makers in Intelligence analysis activities. The main result presented in the paper stems from a work of refinement and abstraction of previous results of the authors related to the use of Situation Awareness and Granular Computing for the development of analysis methods and techniques to support Intelligence. This work made it possible to derive the characteristics of the model from previous case studies and applications with real data, and to link the reasoning techniques to concrete approaches used by intelligence analysts such as, for example, the Structured Analytic Techniques. The model allows to represent an operational situation according to three complementary perspectives: descriptive, relational and behavioral. These three perspectives are instantiated on the basis of the principles and methods of Granular Computing, mainly based on the theories of fuzzy and rough sets, and with the help of further structures such as graphs. As regards the reasoning on the situations thus represented, the paper presents four methods with related case studies and applications validated on real data.

JOUR ,,,,,"Throughout recent years, several researchers have proposed computational tools and algorithms to support team formation in the classroom. The result is that team formation algorithms have been widely applied in classroom environments to create well-balanced teams. One of the challenges in designing algorithms for automatic team formation is designing an appropriate function to estimate team performance, which is used as part of the optimization algorithm that divides students into teams. This function (referred to as a team evaluation heuristic) serves as an approximation to team performance, which is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to quantitatively assess in many settings and that cannot be accurately calculated prior to the task at hand. Despite showing their relative success compared to traditional and manual team formation strategies (manually employed by lecturers and teachers), there is a lack of research comparing team evaluation heuristics in a real classroom setting. Such a comparison would help teachers, practitioners, and system designers to appropriately select the most suitable team formation algorithms. In this article, we present an experimental evaluation that was carried out in a Bachelor’s Degree Program in Tourism that compares two team evaluation heuristics based on Belbin and Myer-Briggs. The experimental evaluation was carried out by means of an intelligent, extensible team formation tool whose optimization is based on an integer linear model that can be extended to support different team evaluation heuristics.

JOUR ,,,,,"One of the main challenges for computational legal research is drawing up innovative heuristics to derive actionable knowledge from legal documents. While a large part of the research has been so far devoted to the extraction of purely legal information, less attention has been paid to seeking out in the texts the clues of more complex entities: legally relevant facts whose detection requires to link and interpret, as a unified whole, legal information and results of empirical analyses. This paper presents an ongoing research that points in this direction, trying to devise new ways to support public prosecutors in assessing the dangerousness of individuals and groups under investigation, an activity that precisely relies on the cross-sectional evaluation of legal and empirical data. A knowledge mining strategy will be outlined that lines up, into a single metaheuristic model, information extraction, network-based inference, machine learning and visual analytics. We will focus, in particular, on the integration of graph-based inference and machine learning methods used both to support classification tasks and to explore new forms of man-machine cooperation. Experiments made involving public prosecutors from the Italian Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate and using data from real investigations have not only shown the potentialities of our approach but also offered an opportunity to reflect on the role we could assign to AI when thinking about the future of legal science and practice.

JOUR ,,,,,"The functionality of community buildings not only depends on the damage to individual buildings but also on the interactions with other infrastructure systems. This paper incorporates these interactions by applying the systems thinking approach to analyze community resilience. The proposed framework starts with identifying the physical infrastructure systems and key components in a community. Then, the seismic hazard scenarios are defined, and the component damage and recovery are assessed by utilizing fragility and consequence functions. After that, a network model, considering the interdependencies between the utility networks and the dependency of utility networks on the community buildings, is introduced to evaluate the component-level building functionality. Finally, community resilience is assessed by proposing community-level indicators including inherent resilience, community functionality, and access to essential facilities. The proposed model is illustrated on a community consisting of building portfolios, water, and electric power systems under four hazard scenarios. It is concluded that the systems thinking approach considered at a community level provides important insights into community resilience such as building functionality, utility demand, and supply, and access to essential facilities, among others.

JOUR ,,,,,"Darwin claimed that human and animal minds differ in degree but not in kind, and that ethical principles such as the Golden Rule are just an extension of thinking found in animals. Both claims are false. The best way to distinguish differences in degree from differences in kind is by identifying mechanisms that have emergent properties. Recursive thinking is an emergent capability found in humans but not in other animals. The Golden Rule and some other ethical principles such as Kant’s categorical imperative require recursion, so they constitute ethical thinking that is restricted to humans. Changes in kind have tipping points resulting from mechanisms with emergent properties.

JOUR ,,,,,"The biomedical literature makes extensive use of the concept of a genetic program. So far, however, the nature of genetic programs has received no satisfactory elucidation from the standpoint of computer science. This unsettling omission has led to doubts about the very existence of genetic programs, on the grounds that gene regulatory networks lack a predetermined schedule of execution, which may seem to contradict the very idea of a program. I show, however, that we can make perfect sense of genetic programs, if only we abandon the preconception that all computers have a von Neumann architecture. Instead, genetic programs instantiate the computational architecture of Post–Newell Production Systems. That is, genetic programs are unordered sets of conditional instructions, instructions that fire independently when their conditions are matched. For illustration I present a paradigm Production System that regulates the functioning of the well-known lac operon of E. coli. On close reflection it turns out that not only genes, but also proteins encode instructions. I propose, therefore, to rename genetic programs to biomolecular programs. Biomolecular and/or genetic programs, and the cellular computers than run them, are to be understood not as von Neumann computers, but as Post–Newell production systems.

JOUR ,,,,,"The pervasive adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications has exponentially increased the demand for efficient resource allocation, workload scheduling, and parallel computing capabilities in cloud environments. This research addresses the critical need for enhancing both the scalability and security of AI/ML workloads in cloud computing settings. The study emphasizes the optimization of resource allocation strategies to accommodate the diverse requirements of AI/ML workloads. Efficient resource allocation ensures that computational resources are utilized judiciously, avoiding bottlenecks and latency issues that could hinder the performance of AI/ML applications. The research explores advanced parallel computing techniques to harness the full possible cloud infrastructure, enhancing the speed and efficiency of AI/ML computations. The integration of robust security measures is crucial to safeguard sensitive data and models processed in the cloud. The research delves into secure multi-party computation and encryption techniques like the Hybrid Heft Pso Ga algorithm, Heuristic Function for Adaptive Batch Stream Scheduling Module (ABSS) and allocation of resources parallel computing and Kuhn–Munkres algorithm tailored for AI/ML workloads, ensuring confidentiality and integrity throughout the computation lifecycle. To validate the proposed methodologies, the research employs extensive simulations and real-world experiments. The proposed ABSS_SSMM method achieves the highest accuracy and throughput values of 98% and 94%, respectively. The contributions of this research extend to the broader cloud computing and AI/ML communities.

JOUR ,,,,,"The End-Edge-Cloud (EEC) computing framework can offer low-latency, high-quality services to users of diverse demands by leveraging pervasive resources. However, the inherent disparities in task requirements and the strong heterogeneity of computational resources in these systems make it non-trivial for scheduler design, particularly in high load scenarios (e.g. burst of tasks). This also complicates the adaptation of traditional cloud-oriented schedulers considering their limited support of heterogeneous processors and accelerators (e.g., CPUs, GPUs and NPUs). In light of this, we first present a system framework for task scheduling in the EEC architecture. In the framework we adopt a reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduler tailored for reducing task completion time and waiting time. Our method integrates task characteristics and environmental constraints within matrices, based on which an adapted Q-Learning agent is employed for decision making. We then introduce the implementation of our framework that features Kubernetes and Rancher-based coordination with extended support for heterogeneous processing units. Experimentally we built a real-world EEC testbed comprising PC, Atlas 200 DK, and Raspberry PI devices. Evaluation results of our algorithm demonstrate a 271% enhancement in performance compared to existing algorithms in the context of burst-arrival task queues, which underscores the efficacy of our solution in realistic scenarios.

Similarly, the discussion of preventive measures is equally bountiful. While there are a number of empirical studies that are related to digitalization, a gap in how we theorize the meaning of digitalization persists. Our aim is to provide an integrated synthesis needed for understanding school shootings in the digital era. Via a narrative literature review, we identified three explanatory themes, namely strain, imitation, and digital mediation. These were synthesized in order to explain more thoroughly how individuals come to participate in online school shooting subculture, possibly leading to their perpetration of school shootings. Based on this, a model is presented that excels in its focus on the ever more prominent role of digitality in everyday life as well as in its broad social science and behavioral explanations.

In terms of difficulties, teachers described initial concerns regarding how to achieve what they had planned, imagined or expected, and they expressed difficulties related to the edition of imported images for objects and scenarios and related to the block-based programming practices. Participants resorted to a great variety of resources to overcome them, which highlights the importance of making testing and debugging practices more explicit. These findings could be relevant for the design of future learning scenarios, highlighting the importance of providing opportunities to develop a critical approach towards expressed commercial promises as well as opportunities to challenge the rhetoric of computational thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"Digital literacy is a need for our current society. In Mexico, digital incursion programs are barely implemented, which represents an educational delay compared to other countries that have faced the need to integrate the teaching of digital skills, in a wide range of educational levels. This paper presents a learning environment of Computational Thinking called EasyLogic3D, which proposes a novel integration of emotional recognition, gamification, and a 3D environment. Experiments with 102 children from an Elementary School in Mexico were carried out, where cognitive and technological acceptance tests were performed. Analyzing the Cronbach’s alpha score, we found that students accepted the technology (learning environment). Also, the results showed that the perceived enjoyment when using the learning environment was positive. On the other hand, results show that the learning gained through using the learning environment was comparable to a class session in which the same topics and exercises were presented.

JOUR ,,,,,"While Computational thinking (CT) has been adopted in various educational settings, it has not been fully utilized in entrepreneurship education. In particular, technology entrepreneurship education involves project-based learning for creating business value. To help students improve learning outcomes, we propose a new framework of entrepreneurship education that combines business model development and CT. We applied this framework to a capstone course for social innovation, in which undergraduate students were asked to define a social problem, develop a solution, and finally implement the appropriate products and services using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors, and actuators. To evaluate the students’ learning outcomes, we conducted a survey and an interview after the course had finished. The results demonstrate that the students acquired various skills, including technical and implementation skills, and that their awareness of the broad applicability of computing increased. It was also determined that students’ self-efficacy in terms of their software development abilities increased as a result of the course. We discuss the benefits of the various strategies used in the design and implementation of the course and issues that need to be discussed further. Finally, we provide guidelines for designing and implementing CT-based project courses.

Therefore, unprecedented problem-solving skills have become inevitable. Though dating back to old times, computational thinking skill is defined as a recent skill area that is required by everybody, that can be used to solve the aforementioned complex problems, and that is included in international standards and training programs. In this study, it was aimed to improve computational thinking skills of prospective teachers. In order to do this, a program design which includes contents that prospective theachers can use in daily life and professional life has been developed. This program, which consists mostly of unplugged activities, also includes computer aided and robotic activities. A total of 11 voluntary prospective teachers (7 women and 4 men), who were in their 3rd year of the 4 year education in the 2017–2018 fall semester and did not attend to any programming or computational thinking education training before, participated in the study. In the first application, a 40-h program was carried out with five prospective teachers, while in the second application, an updated 52-h program was carried out with six prospective teachers. A skill test was developed, and applied to measure prospective teachers’ computational thinking skills before and after the prepared program. Moreover, at the end of the training, they were asked to preapare graduation projects and their perspectives on education were examined. It has been observed that the program applied to prospective primary education teachers, who did not take any lessons like programming etc. before, was effective according to the computational thinking related skill tests and their graduation projects. It has been also observed in prospective primary education teachers that their thinking skills such as problem solving and questioning were improved and they could reflect their acquired knowledge and skills to their daily and professional life.

JOUR ,,,,,"Despite a growing recognition that K-12 teachers should be prepared to teach students computational thinking (CT) skills across disciplines, there is a lack of valid instrumentation that measures teachers’ efficacy beliefs to do so. This study addresses this problem by developing and validating an instrument that measures in-service teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs for teaching CT. In parallel, we conducted a regression analysis to predict teachers’ self-efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs for teaching CT based on demographic traits of the respondents. We surveyed a total of 330 K-12 in-service teachers. A combination of classical test theory and item response theory Rasch was used to validate the instrument. Our results yielded a valid and reliable tool measuring teaching efficacy beliefs for CT. Based on the differential item functioning analysis, the instrument did not reflect bias with gender, race, or teaching experience. Additionally, a regression analysis did not reveal significant predictors using teachers’ demographic characteristics. This suggests a need for looking at other factors that may significantly predict K-12 teachers’ teaching efficacy beliefs for CT to inform theory and practice around successful CT teaching and learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"Understanding the principles of computational thinking (CT), e.g., problem abstraction, decomposition, and recursion, is vital for computer science (CS) students. Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students’ understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other’s mini game concepts. In addition, students were motivated toward designing educational mini games in their future studies. This study also demonstrates how to conduct OCD with students, presents lesson learned, and provides recommendations based on the authors’ experience. ",,,"Laine, Teemu H.

JOUR ,,,,,"Visual programming environments are popular instruments in teaching Computational Thinking (CT) in schools today. Applying Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) programming can influence the development of computational thinking when forcing pupils to anticipate the unforeseen in their computer programs. SRA-programming originates from the programming of tangible robots, but can also be of equal value in visual programming with on-screen output. The underlying rationale is that programming in a visual programming environment using SRA leads to more understanding of the computational concepts addressed, resulting in a higher level of computational skill compared to visual programming without the application of SRA. Furthermore, it has been hypothesised that if pupils in a visual programming environment can anticipate unforeseen events and solve programming tasks by applying SRA, they will be better able to solve complex computational thinking tasks. To establish if characteristic differences in the development of computational thinking can be measured when SRA-programming is applied in a visual programming environment with an on-screen output, we assessed the applicability of SRA-programming with visual output as the main component of the execution of developed code. This research uses a pre-test post-test design that reveals significant differences in the development of computational thinking in two treatment conditions. To assess CT, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) was used. Results show that when using SRA-programming in a visual programming environment it leads to an increased understanding of complex computational concepts, which results in a significant increase in the development of computational thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been formally incorporated into the National Curriculum of Thailand since 2017, where Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, has been widely adopted as CT learning environment for primary-level students. However, conducting hands-on coding activities in a classroom has caused substantial challenges including mixed-ability students in the same class, high student-teacher ratio and learning-hour limitation. This research proposes and develops ScratchThAI as a conversation-based learning support framework for computational thinking development to support both students and teachers. More specifically, it provides learning experiences tailored to individual needs. Students can learn CT concepts and practice online coding anywhere, anytime. Moreover, through its ScratChatbot, students can ask for CT concept explanations, coding syntax or practice exercises. Additional exercises may be assigned to students based on the diagnosed individual learning difficulties in a particular topic to provide possible and timely intervention. Teachers can track learning progress and performance of the whole class as well as of individuals through the dashboard and can take suitable intervention within limited school hours. Deploying ScratchThAI to several Thai schools has enabled this research to investigate its effectiveness in a school setting. The obtained results indicated positive teacher satisfaction, better learning performance and higher student engagement.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study adopted a meta-analysis to explore the effectiveness of unplugged activities (UA) and programming exercises (PE) teaching approaches on computational thinking (CT) education. Through a two-stage literature collection and selection process, 29 articles were included in the meta-analysis, 31 independent effect sizes (16 of UA and 15 of PE) from these articles were used, and a total of 2,764 participants were involved in these studies. CMA software version 3.3 was used to analyze the collected data. The result of the meta-analysis showed that both the UA and PE teaching approaches are useful in cultivating students’ CT. Besides, the effect of the PE teaching approach is better than the UA teaching approach in CT education. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of moderator variables (grade level, interdisciplinary course, and experiments duration) on the relationship between UA or PE and CT education. The results showed that the effects of UA teaching approach in CT education was stronger (a) for primary school students than for secondary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with long duration teaching experiments than with medium and short duration teaching experiments. However, these effects are not significant. The effects of the PE teaching approach in CT education were stronger (a) for secondary school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with short duration teaching experiments than with long and medium duration teaching experiments. These effects are not significant either. Therefore, we suggest that (1) the UA teaching approach should be used more for primary school students, while the PE teaching approach should be used more for secondary students; (2) CT education should be integrated into other subjects through UA and PE teaching approaches, and (3) the UA teaching approach requires more teaching time than the PE teaching approach does in CT education.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking – the ability to reformulate and solve problems in ways that can be undertaken by computers – has been heralded as a foundational capability for the 21st Century. However, there are potentially different ways to conceptualise and measure computational thinking, for instance, as generalized problem solving capabilities or as applied practice during computer programming tasks, and there is little evidence to substantiate whether higher computational thinking capabilities using either of these measures result in better quality computer programs. This study examines the relationship between different forms of computational thinking and two different measures of programming quality for a group of 37 pairs of pre-service teachers. General computational thinking capabilities were measured using Bebras tests, while applied computational thinking processes were measured using a Computational Thinking Behavioural Scheme. The quality of computer programs was measured using a qualitative rubric, and programs were also assessed using the Dr Scratch auto-grading platform. The Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (3rd edition, TONI-3) was used to test for confounding effects. While significant correlations between both measures of computational thinking and program quality were detected, regression analysis revealed that only applied computational thinking processes significantly predicted program quality (general computational thinking capability and non-verbal intelligence were not significant predictors). The results highlight the importance of students developing applied computational thinking procedural capabilities more than generalized computational thinking capabilities in order to improve the quality of their computer programs.

Mixed-method research was carried out to explore whether there were differences between the groups, and to learn the students' opinions and experiences regarding the practices. For the quantitative phase, a quasi-experimental design was used with two groups. For qualitative phase, 12 students were interviewed. The participants were 84 sixth-grade students (between the ages of 10 and 11). The intervention was designed on a selection/construction of activities from seven different basic programming web platforms for the plugged-in group and the proposed national curriculum unplugged activities for the unplugged group. The results showed that significant differences between groups in academic achievement favoring the unplugged activities, but not in CT skills. Development in CT skills contributed to the unplugged group's academic achievement. In addition, qualitative results showed that the plugged-in group perceived their activities as fun and entertaining, but not exactly like a lesson; in contrast, the unplugged group did not experience anxiety or boredom since they perceived the activities as educational. CT explained 27 percent of the variance in academic achievement, suggesting that this skill is important for academic achievement in basic programming. These results suggest that students can improve their academic achievement and maintain the level of CT acquisition across unplugged and plugged-in activities. This article contributes to the body of knowledge about the positive impact of unplugged activities on teaching CT and programming fundamentals.

JOUR ,,,,,"The aim of this study is to explore the computational thinking (CT) processes of university students with the integration of CAS and ACODESA method within the context of problem-solving. The participants of the study are 22 university students. The embedded design was used in the study. The qualitative data consists of the written products of the students, the Maple files, and the transcriptions of argumentations while the quantitative data consists of the pre and post-test scores of the students in CT practices. The implementation was based on ACODESA method. The pre and post-test scores were compared through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It was concluded that ACODESA method had a statistically significant effect on students’ CT performances in the problem-solving process, cognitive processes and transposition. The qualitative data were analyzed within the framework of Habermas' construct of rationality. It was seen that in the series problem, the students showed improvement in constructing factorial concept and exponential expressions with a for loop, defining events and using them as conditionals within the if–then comparison statement. In the vector problem, the students showed improvement in constructing the components of n-dimensional vectors, constructing a for loop to find the angle between these vectors, using the if–then comparison statement to check the equality of the dimensions. The students were able to act more rationally in choosing and using the CT concepts suitable for the purpose and transferring the CT process to the others, thanks to productive argumentations and the semiotic mediational role of the Maple.

Researchers developed some scales for measuring abstraction in BBPEs; however, it is still quite difficult to measure abstraction and understand students’ abstraction behaviors. The aim of this study is to suggest tasks that could help enhance students’ abstraction skills while teaching CT via block-based programming. In addition, a rubric to score the students’ abstraction behaviors in the problem solving process was created and validated. A framework with regard to the definitions of abstraction skill was adopted and the way to isolate it from other CT-skills was proposed. As a result, pattern recognition, generalizing, decomposition, focusing and eliminating were defined as indicators of abstraction in the problem solving process via BBPEs. The study also informed computer science educators about the relations between teaching CT via BBPEs, affordances of BBPEs and nature of abstraction.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered a group of problem-solving skills that the next generations are expected to possess. The most efficient way to make them acquire these skills is to incorporate CT into K-12 education. To this end, various education programs have been designed to improve teachers’ and prospective teachers’ competence in CT. Such programs designing educational experiences based on teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preexisting opinions and self-efficacy perceptions about CT could achieve better results. Although the acquisition of CT skills has been suggested to start early on, these beliefs of early childhood teachers and prospective teachers have been underexplored. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to examine early childhood teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preconceptions and self-efficacy about CT. The study was conducted with 63 teachers and 78 prospective teachers in Turkey. Data were collected via an online survey in the spring of the 2020–2021 academic year. The preconceptions were assessed using a structured questionnaire, while the CT self-efficacy was measured with the Computational Thinking Scale. The findings showed similarities between teachers and prospective teachers in the preconceptions of CT. Both of them most strongly associated CT with logical thinking, problem-solving, using algorithms, coding/programming, doing mathematics, using technology in teaching, and using computers. Yet, teachers reported stronger associations between CT and logical thinking, using algorithms, and coding/programming. Furthermore, teachers’ self-efficacy perceptions in CT were significantly higher. The study findings provide some needed information to design professional development programs aiming to enhance CT practices in early education settings.

Item response theory analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and calculation of Cronbach’s alpha were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the validity and reliability of the two measurements. The results showed that these two measurements are acceptable for assessing CT among young children, demonstrating good validity and reliability, despite limitations such as the weak factor loadings of some items and low internal consistency of subfactors. These two CT measurements were significantly and positively correlated with early mathematical ability. Thus, these two measurements are acceptable for assessing CT among young children with varying CT ability, as they present good psychometric properties of the overall scores even though they have low internal consistency of subfactors and slightly weak correlations between subfactors.

The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education.

In this study, we examined high school students’ patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students’ model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques.

The four constructs taken into account based on the theoretical foundations were computational thinking (CT) levels, design thinking (DT) levels, STEAM interdisciplinary levels, and literacy-oriented (LO) levels. CT was operationalized as four indicators (i.e., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm steps), and DT was operationalized as another four indicators (i.e., analysis of design requirements, creative brainstorming, hands-on experience, and test and verification). Meanwhile, STEAM was operationalized with five indispensable indicators, where each indicator refers to one discipline. LO was operationalized with three indicators (i.e., cooperation and co-creation, problem solving, and daily application). There were 16 indicators in total. Therefore, the formative relationship was established and evaluated in this study. This paper assessed STEAM creations with a formative measurement model comprising four hypotheses indicating that CT has a significant direct effect on STEAM and LO, DT has a significant direct effect on STEAM while STEAM has a significant direct effect on LO. The results reveal that all four hypotheses were accepted and the paths in the model were confirmed. CT has a significant indirect effect on LO through STEAM, which was also deeply discussed.

JOUR ,,,,,"In recent years, computational thinking (CT) initiatives have been increasing in both research and practice. Although the importance of students’ resilience and computational identity in the CT development process is recognized, more research is needed on their role on students’ CT skills. Therefore, little is known about whether differences in students’ CT performance and CT self-efficacy (CTSE) are related to computational identity and academic resilience for programming (ARP). This study aims to understand how secondary school students’ latent profiles are distributed according to computational identity and ARP using a person-centered approach. Afterward, the current research examines how these profiles differ according to CT test performance and CTSE scores. The participants of the study consisted of 601 secondary school students. Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles based on computational identity and resilience: (a) low, (b) low to moderate, (c) moderate to high, (d) high. The effect of profile membership and gender on CTSE and CT test performance was determined by two-way ANOVA analysis. CTSE score increases in profiles where the level of identity and resilience increases. The impact of profiles and gender interaction on CTSE is significant. Low profile male students have significantly lower CTSE scores than other groups. While profiles affected CT performance significantly, no difference is found by gender.

This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of 28 empirical studies on K-12 programming teaching that were published in international education journals in the 21st century to determine which teaching methods and programming tools are most effective in promoting the computational thinking of K-12 students. The results show that (1) programming teaching can promote the improvement of K-12 students’ computational thinking (ES = 0.72, z = 9.9, P < 0.01), with an overall effect at the upper-middle level (95% CI[0.60,0.83]); (2) scaffolding programming (ES = 1.84, z = 11.9, P < 0.01) and problem-based programming (ES = 1.14, z = 5.57, P < 0.01) are the most effective teaching methods and can significantly promote the development of K-12 students’ computational thinking (chi2 = 40.58, P < 0.01); (3) since differences in the effect of programming tools between groups are not significant (Chi2 = 6.47, P = 0.09), it is impossible to determine which programming tools are most effective; and (4) intervention duration (ES = 0.72, z = 11.9, P < 0.05, 95% CI[0.60, 0.83]) and learning scaffold (ES = 0.83, z = 6.27, P < 0.05, 95% CI[0.57, 1.09]) are both key moderating variables that affect the improvement of computational thinking.

We classified the elements of the teacher’s process into two practices: intentional and unintentional use of computational thinking. Intentional use of computational thinking included the teacher’s explicit incorporation of any of the four computational thinking elements (abstraction, algorithms, decomposition, and patterns) into her teaching practice. The unintentional use of computational thinking included those instances where the teacher used computational thinking as a means for teaching content not specifically oriented toward computational thinking. In addition, our work identifies how this bilingual teacher’s instructional dynamics integrated computational thinking and Spanish in a nearly inseparable manner. With this work we intend to contribute to the emergent scholarship committed to understanding the promotion of learning computing in K-5 settings.

According to the results, adaptive educational game design was made for a wide variety of fields such as programming teaching, physics, mathematics, computational thinking, and logic. As for adaptive factors; It was determined that adaptations were made for the game, educational content, interface, and non-player character (NPC) behaviors. It is understood that pre-game adaptation and in-game adaptation methods are used as adaptation types. Finally, it is seen that Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, deep learning, item response theory, and decision tree methods are preferred as decision systems in the adaptation process. The findings of this literature review can facilitate the design process by providing a roadmap for researchers interested in adaptive educational game design.

JOUR ,,,,,"Teaching and learning Computational Thinking (CT) is at the forefront of educational interest. In the process of teaching and learning CT, learning strategies and tools play an important role. Efforts have been made to apply several learning strategies for teaching Computational Thinking. Among them, game-based learning and scaffolding are widely adopted. However, more research is needed on how the absence and presence of scaffolding strategies in programming games could affect students' cognitive CT learning gains. This study aims to investigate the effect of scaffolding programming games on the development of middle school students’ CT. In addition, herein we aim to explore the effect of students’ programming attitudes in their CT development. To this end, students were introduced to CT under two distinct experimental conditions: a scaffolding version of a programming game and a non-scaffolding version of the same game. Results report statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-intervention CT scores for all students and statistically significant improvement in learning outcomes in favor of the scaffolding group. In addition, the study hypothesized that attitudes towards programming would have an impact on students’ CT. Although this hypothesis has not been confirmed, the results suggest that students who have a less positive attitude towards programming could particularly benefit from scaffolding aspects in programming games.

JOUR ,,,,,"Programming and creative thinking are important skills for the twenty-first century. A large body of evidence suggests that a playful approach to learning helps children engage deeply with programming, improves their creative thinking skills, and shapes a positive attitude towards programming. However, such research has rarely considered how differences in socioeconomic background impact the way children experience such programming activities. The theoretical perspective of science capital suggests that children from high income families will hold more positive attitudes towards science and technology and will perform better in programming than children from lower income families based on their generally higher exposure to experiences involving computing technology. To examine this assumption, we designed and implemented single-occasion programming workshops lasting two hours that followed the Lifelong Kindergarten Approach and investigated differences in children’s attitudes, their learning outcomes (measured by a pre-post-test, perceived learning, and task-based performance), and the fun they experienced during the workshops. We collected data from three primary schools in three distinct socioeconomic neighborhoods (i.e., high-, middle-, and low-income areas), involving, in total, 138 children. Findings indicate that the workshops had a positive effect on the children’s attitude towards programming in the middle- and low-income schools only. The self-reported learning was similar in the three schools, but children from the low-income school significantly outperformed children from the high-income school in their task-based performance. Children from the middle-income school had the most fun, however, the experience of fun only significantly affected the low-income school children’s perceived learning scores. We conclude that children from the middle- and low-income schools profited the most from the playful programming workshop and call on future research to investigate further underlying factors of perception, acceptance, and enjoyment of out-of-school programming activities in relation to participants’ socioeconomic background when studying children’s participation of programming in school.

In the study, data were collected in an electronic form consisting of five parts. The model proposed in the research was tested with the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The research showed that the self-efficacy of science teachers was related to technological pedagogical engineering knowledge (TPEK), T- integrated (I) STEM, and technological pedagogical science knowledge (TPSK). In addition, the self-efficacy of science teachers is also effective in design thinking. CT teaching self-efficacy has a positive effect on design thinking and the development of technological pedagogical mathematics knowledge (TPMK), TPEK, and TPSK structures.

To improve the inequitable learning in school, the Project C program has been developed to integrate computational participation and mentoring scheme through social-cognitive approach for underprivileged youth. The aim of this research is to investigate the psychosocial impact of the program, and examine the interrelation between hope, sense of community, and perceived social support in computational learning. The Project C program was piloted in a special school in Hong Kong under the category of Schools for Children with Moderate Intellectual Disability, targeting 8th grade students (n = 51) with SEN (i.e., mild autism) living in low-income residential districts, and a self-reported pre/post questionnaire was administered to measure the psychosocial changes before and after the intervention. The findings reveal a statistically significant change in hope, sense of community, and perceived social support through the program, and the relation between sense of community and hope was fully mediated by the perceived social support.

JOUR ,,,,,"Collaborative learning by teaching (CLBT) is a pedagogical approach that combines collaborative learning and learning by teaching pedagogy, which can be applied to university classrooms with the support of information and communication technology (ICT). This pedagogy not only emphasizes the independent learning of group members, but also emphasizes the process of collaborative learning and cooperative teaching among group members. For current Chinese college students, even with the support of online learning resources and ICT, CLBT is a relatively difficult task for group members, which needs to be combined with some regulatory strategies. Socially shared learning regulation (SSRL) has attracted widespread attention from educators and researchers as an effective collaborative learning regulation strategy, but so far, there is few studies on the effects of SSRL in CLBT environment, especially on psychological variables. This study explored the effects of SSRL on the computational thinking, learning motivation, engagement, and academic achievement of university students in CLBT by conducting a semester-long quasi-experiment in a data mining course with 72 third-year undergraduates at a Chinese public university. The experimental class adopted SSRL in CLBT with 41 students (33 males, eight females), while the control class only implemented CLBT with 31 students (26 males, five females). The independent sample t-test results showed that the students in the experimental class significantly improved their intrinsic motivation, engagement (Deep processing strategy and affective engagement), and computational thinking (Algorithmic thinking, critical thinking and problem solving) than those in the control class. In addition, the student’s academic achievements in the experimental class were significantly higher than the students in the control class.

Therefore, the current study applied an experimental design with a sample of 34 preservice IT teachers to examine whether or not creative programming activities or explicit teaching of programming play a significant role in promoting creative thinking skills. The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Verbal Form was employed to collect the study's data.

Analysis of Covariance statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling were adopted for data analysis. Results showed that the performance of the experimental group in CT skills and SE was considerably better than that of the control group. Moreover, the predictive relationships were more complex between CT skills and SE in the experimental group. In general, these findings confirmed the teaching value of interactive unplugged programming, and further emphasized the important role of students’ CT skills in programming engagement. Therefore, through the application of interaction in instruction design, each student can be assigned a positive role to create a programming classroom that is more conducive to students.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) skills of pre-service teachers have been explored extensively, but the effectiveness of CT training has yielded mixed results in previous studies. Thus, it is necessary to identify patterns in the relationships between predictors of CT and CT skills to further support CT development. This study developed an online CT training environment as well as compared and contrasted the predictive capacity of four supervised machine learning algorithms in classifying the CT skills of pre-service teachers using log data and survey data. First, the results show that Decision Tree outperformed K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes in predicting pre-service teachers’ CT skills. Second, the participants’ time spent on CT training, prior CT skills, and perceptions of difficulty regarding the learning content were the top three important predictors in this model.

JOUR ,,,,,"Theatrical performance constitutes a complicated way for students to express and to communicate with each other, since it targets both various artistic and educational goals. Even though it constitutes a top moment of students’ expression, several students do not feel comfortable when participating in such cultural activities, as performance anxiety, a negative emotional experience stemming from the public audience exposure, affects them. The aim of this research is to apply and evaluate a student segmentation technique with the help of bio-inspired computational intelligence, for identifying high levels of performance anxiety at schoolchildren. A Mayfly-based clustering optimization algorithm is applied on a dataset with 774 instances of students to classify them according to their levels of emotions and performance anxiety that are developed during the event. A comparison with a genetic algorithm as well as particle swarm optimization shows that the proposed method is distinguished by superior categorization capabilities. The findings demonstrate the effective dissimilar student groups formation, with the members of each being distinguished by similar characteristics in terms of emotions and performance anxiety, highlighting the ones with unmanageable emotional experiences. Therefore, the drama educator is able to effortlessly detect, manage students and develop coping practices in those at risk, by acknowledging each group’s characteristics.

JOUR ,,,,,"Collaborative programming can develop computational thinking and knowledge of computational programming. However, the researchers pointed out that because students often fail to mobilize metacognition to regulate and control their cognitive activities in a cooperation, this results in poor learning effects. Especially low-achieving students need more metacognitive support. Therefore, this study proposed a metacognition-based collaborative programming approach (M-CPA) to improve students' performance in collaborative programming. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method for students with different levels of learning achievement, a 7-week experiment was conducted. A total of 222 middle school students were divided into the experimental group with the M-CPA learning and the control group with the conventional collaborative programming approach (C-CPA). The results showed that learning methods and learning achievement had interactive effects on computational thinking tendency, critical thinking tendency, and metacognition tendency. M-CPA could significantly improve students' computational thinking tendency, critical thinking tendency, and metacognition tendency. Moreover, the proposed approach is more effective for low-achieving students. The results also showed that M-CPA could improve the students' achievement in program analysis questions.

Digital literacy refers to the ability to communicate with others by using digital technology, including the ability for sharing knowledge and information after user’s creation. A survey was conducted on 212 pre-service early childhood teachers at two Universities located in the eastern United States, and the collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression. As a result of the study, first, pre-service teachers had high critical thinking among the sub-factors of digital literacy, but relatively low problem-solving skills. Second, the relationship between digital literacy, self-efficacy, and the perception of AI education for young children showed a positive correlation. Third, among the sub-factors of digital literacy of pre-service early childhood teachers, technical application, learning interaction, and problem-solving with teachers’ self-efficacy were found to have a significant effect on the perception of AI education for young children. This study proposes that developing a pre-service teacher education program that can improve their digital literacy and self-efficacy is necessary for guiding early childhood teachers to use artificial intelligence technology with young children in early childhood education classrooms in educationally meaningful ways.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) has become the basic foothold of STEAM education. The role of teachers as an essential element of CT education cannot be ignored. Therefore, measuring teachers’ ability to integrate CT into classroom is necessary. There were two sub-studies in this study, the one was to develop a specialized scale for the evaluation of teachers’ CT skills. The other was to take K-12 STEAM teachers as sample to measure their CT levels and analyze the impact of the influential factors of personal attributes, occupational attributes, and environmental support on teachers’ CT skills. The results showed that the Computational Thinking Scale for Teachers (TCTS) has good reliability and validity. The CT skills of 925 STEAM teachers from China were at an upper-middle level. Further analysis revealed significant differences in teachers’ CT skills in terms of gender, age, teaching experience, grade, subjects, and nature of school. Firstly, by contrast, male teachers’ CT skills were slightly higher than female teachers’; 30–40-year-old teachers possessed the highest level of CT skills; Second, the longer the teaching experience, the higher the teachers’ CT skills; primary school teachers’ CT skills were higher than those of middle school and high school teachers; Interdisciplinary comprehensive courses and teaching methods may be more conducive to the improvement of teachers’ CT skills, which acted elementary science teachers’ CT skills were higher than those of teachers of other subjects. Third, the nature of the school also affected the CT skills of STEAM teachers. The CT of teachers in private schools was higher than those in public schools. Therefore, the regional differences and educational equity in teacher’ CT training should also be concerned. Concerning the questions, this study carried out an in-depth discussion and put forward inspiration and suggestions. The research findings revealed the mechanism that affects teachers’ CT skills and provided meaningful evidence support for the training and evaluation of K-12 STEAM in-service teachers.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is a new literacy of 21st century that can be transferred to and applied in different real-world situations, although being derived from the discipline of computer science. Tangible robots or child-friendly digital apps are used to implement coding education with the goal of promoting young children’s CT. However, there are still controversies on the validity and applicability of CT in early childhood, mainly due to the vagueness of the learning mechanism underlying young children’s CT. This cross-sectional study examined the associations among sequencing ability, self-regulation and CT among Chinses preschoolers (N = 101, Mage = 5.25 years, SD = 0.73). Results showed that sequencing ability and self-regulation have positive and significant associations with CT, and the relationship between sequencing ability and CT was fully mediated by self-regulation, even after controlling for child gender, age, and family socioeconomic status (SES). This implies CT in early childhood as a combination of sequencing ability and self-regulation. Findings of this study have implications for early childhood CT education programs, suggesting the need to assist children in learning sequencing and how to self-regulate in coding (both plugged and unplugged) and STEM activities.

The study deals with the problem of developing school students’ computational thinking in online learning. We consider computational thinking as a set of cognitive skills of solving educational and cognitive problems. The research questions raised were aimed at solving the problem of the influence of Educational Robotics on developing computational thinking. During the research we have found out that due to the adaptability of robots, Educational Robotics, the development of individual learning programs, and the arrangement of collaborative online learning are instruments and a solution to the problem of developing computational thinking. The main components of computational thinking, which were studied within those 3 years, are the following: algorithmic thinking, ability to program, and efficiency in team work. The influence of the learning strategy we chose enabled us to determine the level of computational thinking and its dependence on learning Robotics. We used statistical criteria in order to summarize the results of our research. The statistics provided suggests progress in the indicator tracked. Based on the experimental data received we approximated reliability (R2) and relevant exponential equation (trend lines). The research we carried out also has led to the general conclusion that Educational Robotics helps to create synergistic learning environment for stimulating students’ motivation, collaboration, self-efficacy and creativity.

However, it lacks studies to evaluate the effect of coding learning on the various dimensions of CT in young Chinese children. To provide insight into this question, we recruited children aged 5–6 years to participate in the quasi-experimental study involving an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group learned collaboration- and robot-based coding for 12 lessons, whereas children in the control group attended school learning activities. The two groups showed significant changes in CT concepts after coding learning, but the changes were not different between the two groups. In addition, coding learning positively influenced the development of CT practices, including algorithm and debugging skills. Finally, qualitative analyses showed that children could express, connect, and question after learning coding, suggesting that coding learning benefits the development of CT perspectives. To summarize, coding learning positively influences the ability to apply coding concepts to solve problems in practice and the perspectives about themselves and the world around them.

For carrying out this qualitative study 25 articles were selected, based on a systematic research literature review, and analyzed to provide didactic orientation for the integration of CT in mathematics lessons with the use of the Bee-Bot robot (or similar). For this purpose, a thematic analysis method was applied to the selected research articles, focusing on the didactic explanations and suggestions for using educational robots to develop computational thinking. The themes used to analyze the data are according to the six dimensions (epistemic, cognitive, interactional, mediational, affective and ecological) of the didactic suitability proposed by the Ontosemiotic approach. The analysis allowed us to classify twelve didactic orientations according to the dimensions. Four of the twelve orientations refer to the epistemic dimension; three to the cognitive dimension; two are related to the interactional dimension; one to the mediational dimension, one to the affective dimension and another to the ecological dimension.

A computational thinking framework along with six units of programming lessons were developed as a part of the research, aiming to develop primary (or elementary) school students’ computational problem-solving skills through a hybrid-based design of programming activities: combining unplugged (i.e., embodied cognitive activities without computing devices) and plugged (i.e., programming activities with computing devices) approach. Five primary schools participated in our main study, and a mixed method research was conducted with 400 fourth grade students (Male = 259; Female = 141) and 18 teachers involved in delivering our designed lessons. The findings in our study show that students achieved learning gains in basic computational thinking skills in solving programming problems under this hybrid-based learning approach. These findings can give insight for educators and researchers interested in incorporating computational thinking in primary education, which sets forth a research direction on the developmental aspects of computational thinking for children in the neo-Piagetian perspective.

The main characteristic of unplugged programming is that it comprises activities without the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Since previous research has shown that the application of sense-reason-act (SRA) programming with different types of output demonstrated a better understanding of underlying complex programming concepts with an impact on CT, our research investigates whether the application of unplugged programming, offered via SmartGames, can also generate such a distinctive impact on developing CT. To capture the effects of the different interventions applied, a mixed-methods study was conducted among primary school students aged ten to twelve. Research data were obtained by means of a pretest–posttest questionnaire survey using the validated Computational Thinking Test (CTt), and by conducting interviews to determine the effects of CT and to ascertain identifiable learning effects. Our research indicates that unplugged programming by applying SmartGames can be a consummate regarding the development of CT, similar to SRA-programming using either robotics with tangible output or robot simulations with on-screen output. The research findings identified support our claim that the application of unplugged SmartGames shows equivalent development on CT sub-characteristics in comparison with plugged-in SRA-programming with tangible or on-screen output.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational Thinking (CT) is an emerging topic in school curricula. Different tools exist to support the learning of CT, namely visual programming languages and tangible development platforms (TDP), which are widely used in extra-curricular activities. To date, few tools have been developed that consider both teachers’ needs and the school context. We designed the Kniwwelino Classroom Kit (KCK) in order to support the teaching of CT in classrooms. This paper presents the results of a pilot study, in which the KCK was used in three primary and three secondary schools in Luxembourg. The KCK is based on Kniwwelino, a creative environment designed for children from 8 years old to learn about programming and electronics. The study explored the suitability of the KCK for teaching CT in primary and secondary schools, focusing on three research questions: (1) how the KCK supports teachers’ pedagogical practices, (2) how the KCK fulfils the pedagogical objectives set by teachers, and (3) the user experience of the KCK (for teachers and pupils). To assess how the KCK meets the three above-mentioned objectives, we used a mixed method approach, combining semi-guided interviews, logbooks, and several questionnaires. We learned that the KCK is versatile enough to adapt to different environments, objectives, and pedagogical approaches, which responds to the first two research questions, and thus offers a great deal of freedom to teachers. The fun and tangible approach of the KCK introduces programming and enables pupils to develop both CT and soft skills such as communication and collaboration. Teachers’ feedback on their user experience was positive, particularly concerning stimulation, novelty, and attractiveness. KCK was evaluated as interesting, valuable, and good, but it was noted that some improvements needed to be made to make it easier, more predictable, and faster. The pupils also rated their user experience positively, with values that were generally on a par with previous studies reported in the state of the art regarding the use of Scratch and BBC Micro:bit in school-based experiments for learning CT. Drawing from these learnings, we list several recommendations for the development of other similar TDP tools to support the teaching of CT in a classroom setting. These recommendations concern the material, programming interface, connection, educational material, and the creation of a community.

We conducted an experiment on how smartphones can be used to reinforce biology lessons of seventh standard students (mean age = 12.22 years) in a private school in India. Students of four sections were taught about respiration in human beings and other organisms following four different approaches. The first section of students was taught without using any digital tool, while the second, third and fourth sections were taught using YouTube videos, a tutorial app that provided study materials and quizzes for self-assessment, and an interactive app that displayed a three-dimensional model of an organ system from which students could learn interactively, respectively. The intervention lasted one month and its effectiveness was assessed by a post-test and collecting feedback from the students. The students of the third and fourth sections exhibited better lower-order thinking skills in the post-test, while the students of the second and fourth sections exhibited better higher-order thinking skills. Further, the students felt that they could easily use the tool they were taught with and learn details of the respiratory system from it. The students of the second and fourth sections typically found the diagrams and animation in the YouTube videos and the interactive app, respectively to be useful, while the students of the third section did not find the diagrams in the tutorial app to be of much use.

JOUR ,,,,,"How to develop students' computational thinking (CT) is an important topic faced by academics and front-line teachers. However, the solution of programming problems requires paying attention to every detail of the problem and building a solution to the problem step by step, and for beginners, they often get stuck when one of these aspects goes wrong because of the lack of metacognitive abilities. The integration of metacognitive scaffolding in project-based programming instruction can help students identify their strengths, become more aware of their learning status and identify problems in a timely manner. Therefore, this study designed a metacognitive scaffolding in four aspects: planning, monitoring, reflecting and evaluating, and assessed the effects of this scaffolding on students' CT, learning achievement and metacognitive abilities through a quasi-experimental design. The participants were 70 students aged 9–11 years in elementary school, where the experimental group (38 students) used a metacognitive scaffolding-based project-based learning approach, while the control group (32 students) used a traditional project-based learning approach. The results indicate that metacognitive scaffolding has a facilitative effect in helping students improve their CT and learning achievement, but does not significantly improve metacognitive abilities. This study provides insights into the deeper development of students' CT development and metacognitive scaffolding design.

JOUR ,,,,,"K-12 artificial intelligence (AI) education requires cultivating students’ computational thinking in the school curriculum so as to transfer their computational thinking to diverse problems and authentic contexts. However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students’ computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students’ computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students’ AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI. Implications for designing the AI curriculum are discussed.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper provides a longitudinal analysis of the understanding of repetition patterns by 24 Spanish children ages 3, 4 and 5, through representation and the type of justification. A mixed quantitative and qualitative study is conducted to establish bridges between algebraic thinking and computational thinking by teaching repetition patterns in technological contexts. The data are obtained using: a) participant observations; b) audio-visual and photographic records; and c) written representations, in drawing format, from the students. The analysis involves, on the one hand, a statistical analysis of the representations of patterns, and on the other, an interpretive analysis to describe the type of justification that children use in technological contexts: “elaboration”, “validation”, “inference” and “prediction or decision-making”. The results show that: a) with respect to the representation of patterns, errors decreased by 27.3% in 3-to-5-year-olds, with understanding and correct representation of repetition patterns gaining prominence in more than 50% of the sample from the age of 4; b) on the type of justification used, it is evident that in 3-and-4-year-olds, “elaboration” predominates, and at 5, progress is made towards “validation”. We conclude that it is necessary to design learning sequences connected with theory and upheld through practice, and that foster the active role of the teacher as a promoter of teaching situations that help spur the beginning of computational and algebraic thinking.

The sample included 286 National Research Mordovia State University n.a. N.P. Ogarev University third-year students who were enrolled full-time. The first group was trained using traditional teaching methods, while the second group attended virtual reality courses in the context of the case method. To assess the level of thinking and creativity, the Jerome Bruner questionnaire was used. Academic achievement was measured using a five-point scale. The study revealed that when comparing the groups using classical teaching methods and the case method with the help of virtual reality technology, students’ learning achievements do not differ (p˃0.05); the average scores are 3.88 ± 0.75 and 4.16 ± 0.62 respectively; however, there was a tendency for an increase in the total score in the group where virtual reality was used. A case-method technology study in the context of virtual reality among engineering students revealed a connection between academic achievement and object, visual, iconic, symbolic thinking and creativity: the higher the basic type of thinking, the higher the academic achievement.

They aspire to design quality systems or games after acquiring related skills but report concerns that programming logic is too difficult to learn because memorization of the syntax is required. Thus, they experience anxiety, are demotivated to learn, and, regretfully, may never enroll in programming courses. Computational thinking (CT) is a favorable method currently used in learning logic. This study proposed an easily implementable standard operating procedure for CT and incorporated it into programming courses; students were instructed and enabled to clarify the logical sequence before beginning to write a program. The standard operating procedure for CT contains five training steps, identify the problem, formulate the problem-solving steps, organize and summarize, draw a flowchart, and write a program. This kind of training can help students clarify the logical order more clearly to facilitate writing programs, thereby improving motivation to learn, reducing learning anxiety, and ultimately improving learning outcomes. The experiment results revealed significant results regarding the learning outcomes, motivation to learn, and learning anxiety of the experimental group learning programming through CT-centered teaching in comparison with those of the group learning through conventional teaching. Additionally, for female students, who were revealed to be initially less capable of logical thinking than male students, the following post intervention improvements were observed: adequate improvement in learning outcomes, increased motivation to learn, and reduced learning anxiety.

The study aims to characterize OER platforms that facilitate the development of such skills, grounded in UNESCO’s recommendations and the evolving definitions of complex thinking. Utilizing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), the research focuses on three key questions: the type of open license allowing 5R activities, the technical options based on the ALMS Framework, and the sub-competencies of complex thinking that can be nurtured through OER. The study identifies and categorizes key platforms conducive to the development of complex thinking skills, namely innovative, critical, scientific, and systemic thinking. These platforms are analyzed based on their licensing types and technical capabilities. Findings indicate that most of the platforms studied support 5R activities under Creative Commons licenses, require advanced editing skills, and more than half address multiple subcompetencies of complex thinking. The study concludes that the adaptation, reuse, and redistribution of OER can significantly contribute to fostering complex thinking skills, aligning educational practices with 21st-century demands.

JOUR ,,,,,"While numerous studies have highlighted the potential benefits of programming environment (PE) use for children’s learning, the boundary conditions of children’s PE acceptance within the programming education context are less clear. This study fills this gap in the literature by investigating the critical determinants of children’s PE use intention and extending the boundary conditions to programming competition, computational thinking, and programming modality. A total of 1527 primary students participated in this study. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses, the measurement model was validated, and the configural, metric and scalar invariance of the measurement model was established. The structural model was also confirmed, with most of the hypothesized relationships were supported. Multigroup SEM analyses were conducted to compare structural path coefficient differences across different personal moderators (i.e., gender, grade, and experience), environmental moderators (i.e., both parents’ education level), and PE use-relevant moderators (i.e., programming competition, computational thinking, and programming modality). The results revealed significant path differences in six group comparisons, with most of the path differences associated with perceived self-efficacy and perceived ease of use. It should be noted that no significant path differences were identified for the gender and programming competition group comparisons. This work serves as a pioneer study of a comprehensive understanding of the determinants and moderators of children’s PE use intention. The findings offer important theoretical implications through accommodating essential constructs within a PE acceptance framework and recommending effective strategies to improve primary students’ PE acceptance for programming learning in primary education.

JOUR ,,,,,"Neural and symbolic architectures are key techniques in AI for learner modelling, enhancing adaptive educational services. Symbolic models offer explanation and reasoning for decisions but require significant human effort. On the other hand, neural architectures demand less human input and yield better predictions, yet lack interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education and that incorrectly tailored support can negatively affect learning outcomes, the integration of neural and symbolic architectures becomes crucial. This research proposes a novel neural-symbolic AI approach for temporal learner modelling, called TemporaLM, that leverages unsupervised deep neural networks (i.e., autoencoders enriched with symbolic educational knowledge) and dynamic Bayesian networks for learners’ knowledge tracing over time. The approach employs a dynamic Bayesian network for temporal knowledge tracking in learners' computational thinking and employs a knowledge-based autoencoder to enhance predictive performance through synthetic data augmentation. Our findings from both cross-validation and practical application demonstrate that the TemporaLM approach, trained on the neural-symbolic AI augmented dataset, achieves better generalizability, yielding an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 87%. This surpasses the dynamic Bayesian network trained solely on original and autoencoder-augmented data. Notably, by leveraging the transformed dataset for model training, improvements of up to 8% in F1 score and 5% in accuracy were achieved compared to the original dataset, observed in both cross-validation and application stages. The augmented prediction capabilities, coupled with interpretable knowledge tracing, cultivate trust among educators and learners in data-driven decisions. These findings underline the potential of neural-symbolic family of AI to improve limitation of existing (symbolic) AI methods in education, advancing AI's potential in education and enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the context of our rapidly digitizing society, computational thinking stands out as an essential attribute for cultivating aptitude and expertise. Through the prism of computational thinking, learners are more adeptly positioned to dissect and navigate real-world challenges, poising them effectively to meet the exigencies of future societal landscapes. The paradigm of project-based learning, heralded as a potent educational methodology, significantly amplifies students' prowess in computational thinking. To delineate the nuanced interplay between project-based learning and its augmentation of computational thinking, we engaged in meta-analytical investigations, synthesizing outcomes from 31 distinct external experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Our analytical journey underscored that project-based learning markedly elevates students' competencies across five critical spectra: innovation, collaboration, critical analysis, algorithmic cognition, and problem resolution. Dissecting its impact across the K12 continuum reveals that primary students predominantly hone their collaborative acumen; middle-grade learners witness a pronounced ascent in creativity, critical, and algorithmic faculties, while the apex of high school education primarily sharpens critical analytical prowess. Thus, educators sculpting the contours of project-based learning should be calibrate their strategies, ensuring they resonate with the developmental and age-specific nuances of their audience, to fully unleash its latent potential in nurturing computational thinking.

This study focuses on comprehending problem-solving methodologies by observing the eye movements of 45 primary and multi-year grammar school pupils, aged 11 to 14, as they tackled pictorial geometry problems without computation. The utilization of eye-tracking technology, specifically the OGAMA tool, was essential in unveiling the nuanced strategies employed by students. Visual attention metrics were determined through fixations on predefined areas of interest, identified using the ScanGraph tool. Through an analysis of eye movements, participants were categorized into three distinct groups based on their problem-solving strategies. This categorization facilitated an exploration of the correlation between the chosen strategy and the success rate in solving geometry problems without computational aids. The findings underscore the imperative for continued investigation into strategies for solving geometry problems without computation.

Although most CS education research has focused on the secondary level, only minimal research has explored how computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) can be taught in elementary and especially at kindergarten. Understanding how CS and CT are taught at the youngest levels is critical to support the creation of progressive quality curricula and professional development. Therefore, in this study, we delved into the CT/CS curriculum design considerations of five teachers for kindergarteners. Our findings revealed that the primary learning objectives encompassed: 1) Social skill acquisition, 2) Fostering a growth mindset, and 3) Developing basic CT competencies. Moreover, when crafting their CT/CS curriculum, teachers weighed factors such as 1) Their approach to adapting the CT/CS curriculum—whether it be a personalized approach or relying on a pre-packaged curriculum—and 2) Adhering to Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), which took into account individual abilities, interests, and socially relevant contexts. We conclude by discussing the ramifications of these findings in terms of professional development and the shaping of future CT/CS curricula for young learners.

Currently, there are fewer studies on the overall effects of educational robots on K12 students' computational thinking, especially at the instructional style and cross-grade level. In order to investigate the overall effect of educational robots on students' computational thinking, the study used a meta-analytic approach to analyze 27 experimental and quasi-experimental research papers from the last decade. It was found that: educational robots have a positive and significant effect on K12 students' computational thinking development (SMD = 0.558), and their application effects are influenced by moderating variables such as school level, teaching style, participation style, experimental period, and sample size. Specifically: educational robots have a positive and significant effect on K12 students, with the most significant effect at the early childhood level; there is a significant difference in the development of students' computational thinking when using educational robots in different teaching modes, with the best effect being achieved in the design-based teaching mode; (3) participating in educational robots in small groups is more likely to promote the development of computational thinking in K12 students; (4) Different experimental cycles have a positive effect on students' computational thinking, but a long experimental cycle does not mean a good effect, etc.; (5) There is a significant difference between different sample sizes of educational robots on K12 students' computational thinking, and arranging a medium-sized (50–100 students) educational robotics activity can achieve a better learning effect.

However, the relationship between Bebras tasks and CT is recent and, given the scarcity of validated instruments for assessing CT that are not associated with a specific learning environment, the expected development of CT through Bebras tasks has not been sufficiently evaluated, especially in Primary School. For this reason, we designed the ABC-Thinking program for the development of CT in which a set of Bebras tasks were selected and categorised according to the CT skills they were related to, specific lesson plans were designed to integrate these tasks in a 12-week curriculum, and teachers were trained to apply the program. Using the competent Computational Thinking test (cCTt) in a pre-post-test experimental design, we looked to determine whether Primary School students developed specific CT skills after the program, and, therefore, whether Bebras could be considered suitable for the development of this competence. The results show a significant development in specific CT skills, interesting findings in the gender differences in this development, and between high and low performers. Finally, qualitative data indicate the suitability of the ABC-Thinking program with respect to teachers’ practice.

JOUR ,,,,,"Flipped learning has attracted increasing attention in all grade levels in recent years and becomes an alternative to the traditional model. Even though there is a large body of research on flipped classrooms, they usually ignore the learning theories that were used to construct the curriculum and instead concentrate on the degree to which using such an approach affects student outcomes. The Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) theory provides a foundation for the development of tasks for students’ collaborative learning. Therefore, this study proposes a flipped realistic mathematics education (F-RME) approach to support a mathematics classroom. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental study, pretest–posttest non-equivalent group design, was implemented in a pre-engineering mathematics course. This design was chosen because randomization couldn’t be done when getting the sample population. There were two groups of students: the students who adopted flipped realistic mathematics education (the F-RME group) and those who learned with conventional realistic mathematics education (the C-RME group). The finding revealed a significant increase in the posttest and post-questionnaire due to the implementation of the flipped learning-based approach in conjunction with realistic mathematics education. Moreover, the interview results of the experimental group revealed that students perceived adopting the FL-RME approach as an effective learning strategy that promotes “collaboration and interaction,” “personalized learning” and “problem-solving ability.” Accordingly, discussion of the findings, limitations of the present study, and suggestions for future research are provided.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is valued as a thinking process that is required to adapt to the development of curriculum in primary education. In the context of modern information technology, English as a language subject emphasizes the necessity for changes in both learning and teaching modes. However, there is a lack of up-to-date synthesis research and a comprehensive overview surrounding CT integrated into English language curriculum learning and teaching in primary education. To address this research gap, this study conducted a systematic literature review on CT in the primary English curriculum, based on papers published from 2011 to 2021. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine and present empirical evidence on how CT can be integrated into the teaching and learning of the primary English language curriculum in educational contexts. The review was conducted based on the PRISMA 2020 statement and presents a synthesis of 32 articles. The CT-TPACK model was adopted as a lens and framework to analyze these articles. The results indicate that the relationship among CT, content knowledge of English language curriculum, pedagogy and learning knowledge, technology and resources is highlighted. Research on the integration of CT into English courses using unplugged activities is still insufficient. The research about how teachers and students use CT to support content knowledge of the English language curriculum in various educational contexts is still in its infancy.

Pre- and post-tests were conducted to assess students’ computational thinking and programming performance during a three-week period. We observed significant improvements in the computational thinking skills of the problematization-oriented scaffolding group, particularly in the algorithmic thinking and cooperativity subdimensions, when compared to the control group. Structuring-oriented scaffoldings in videos also helped enhance students’ computational thinking, especially in the algorithmic thinking subdimension. In contrast, students in the control group primarily improved their problem-solving skills, although the difference across the three groups was not significant. Furthermore, this study revealed that the use of learning scaffolds, whether problematization-oriented or structured, significantly contributes to students’ learning achievements in comparison to the control group.

The CT scale was used as a pre-test and post-test to examine the development of the PST’s CT skills for quantitative data collection. The qualitative data comprise the CT-integrated DS projects developed by the PST during the training and the reflection reports they wrote at the end of the training. The paired samples t-test was used in the analysis of quantitative data. The DS projects were evaluated using the rubrics with the story/storyboard, DS, and CT skills dimensions. Reflection reports were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings revealed a significant improvement in the PST’s CT skills after the training program. The qualitative findings show the PST’s perspectives on CT definitions, the perceived benefits of CT and DS, and the use of DS to promote CT. The qualitative findings also present evidence for the CT-integrated DS design skills of the PST. Therefore, the study presents early findings showing that CT components could be integrated with DS and used in teacher education effectively without any pressure to use programming tools. The study also shows how DS is gradually integrated with the CT components as a suggestion for future studies.

Their discourses were recorded, transcribed, and coded based on a CT framework encompassing cognitive, practical, and social perspectives. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to analyze the data. In particular, Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) was applied to explore the patterns of their CT processes. The findings revealed that social perspectives emerged the most frequently in all pairs’ discourses.

The ENA networks revealed that social perspectives mostly centered around cognitive perspectives for all pairs with CT process patterns in HLGs crossing the three perspectives more frequently. In addition, HLGs exhibited a more complicated and developmental trend in solving the two problems, while LLGs displayed a relatively similar CT pattern.

However, female teachers performed better on collaborative skills in CT, indicating that female teachers also have the potential to develop CT. In addition, we found the mediating effects of PA, which means that MER activities affect CT through PA. Furthermore, PA predicted CT positively, suggesting that PA could be a key factor in enhancing CT.

The study uses the following data collection tools: the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) Figural Form A and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV). The digital intervention involved participating in a specially designed digitally-enhanced learning course entitled “Preschoolers: Digital Adventures”. Both training groups exhibited a statistically higher level of creative thinking compared to baseline, as evidenced by TTCT-A scores. The younger training group also had significantly higher scores on all WPPSI-IV subscales, while their peers in the control group failed to show such a result. Older controls significantly improved on all except one WPPSI-IV subscale, i.e., Fluid Reasoning Index subscale, while their peers in the training group scored higher on all WPPSI-IV subscales without exception.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) competency is essential for K-12 students in the digital societies. Understanding the relationship between students’ CT and relevant factors contributes to implementing and improving CT education. Most previous studies investigated the effect of demographic or attitudinal factors on CT performance; whereas few research explored the impact of mindset on CT, and how mindset potentially mediates the relationship between the affective and performance facets of CT. This study adapted a CT assessment instrument and validated it using item response theory (IRT) analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) among N = 961 middle school students in eastern China. Further, two SEMs were fitted and compared to investigate the impact of programming self-efficacy (PSE) and growth mindset (GM) on CT performance.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered to be a critical problem-solving toolkit in the development of every student in the digital twenty-first century. Thus, it is believed that the integration of deeper learning in CT education is an approach to help students transfer their CT skills beyond the classroom. Few literature reviews have mapped deeper learning in CT, especially from the perspective of measuring deeper learning domains in CT. This systematic review uses the PRISMA approach to identify and analyze peer-reviewed, empirical studies on deeper learning domains in CT: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. The following characteristics of the 21 included CT assessment studies were examined: learning domain, sample size, educational level, deeper learning domain, and assessment tool. The results show that most studies: (1) sampled elementary- and middle-school students; (2) focused on STEM disciplines, especially in programming and computer science; (3) targeted cognitive domains; (4) employed knowledge tests and portfolios to measure cognitive domains; (5) used block-based programming such as Scratch as the most common intervention; and (6) indicated that even short  interventions could contribute to deeper learning in CT. This review also identified current trends and gaps in the research on assessing deeper learning domains in CT.

However, existing research primarily focuses on how children learn to code rather than how coding helps them to learn. To address this gap, a quasi-experimental case study was conducted with 31 kindergarten children, aiming to explore what young children could learn from a 4-week curriculum combining programmable robotics and road safety training. The findings indicate that teaching young children to code not only develops their computational thinking (CT), but also enhances their road safety knowledge and skills.

JOUR ,,,,,"Grouping students according to their abilities and promoting deeper interaction and moderation are key issues in improving computational thinking in collaborative programming. However, the distribution characteristics and evolving pathways of computational thinking in different groups have not been deeply explored. During the course of a twelve-week term, 30 sophomores participated in shared regulation-supported collaborative programming activities. This study employed statistical analysis, lag sequence analysis, and epistemic network analysis to examine the effects of ability grouping on students' behavioral patterns and cognitive networks of computational thinking. The study shows heterogeneous groups predominantly engaged with computational practices and ideas, while within homogeneous groups, high-ability groups concentrated on computational practices and low-ability groups on computational concepts. Analysis of behavior sequences across varying ability groups revealed that heterogeneous groups exhibited significantly more behaviors related to monitoring and evaluation, forming a cyclical correlation, unlike homogeneous groups which did not exhibit reflective collaborative effects. Moreover, in the initial phases of collaborative programming, the structure of the computational thinking network varied markedly across groups of different competencies. However, as group awareness tools were progressively employed, the cognitive network centroids of all groups began to show converging trajectories. These results underscore that both shared regulation strategies and grouping strategies can facilitate the enhancement of computational thinking, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance for the higher education sector.

JOUR ,,,,,"Enhancing students’ civic literacy is considered an essential educational goal in the 21st century. Therefore, in the teaching process, how to provide students with opportunities to solve problems and how to provide immediate feedback to help students make correct decisions when facing real problems are important and challenging issues. Digital game-based learning has been identified as an effective method to provide a context with interactive problems. However, a general digital game often lacks a rigorous inspection mechanism for students’ decisions in the game. Hence, some students may complete the learning tasks by guessing or trial and error, thereby affecting their learning outcomes. To deal with this problem, the present study proposed a supportive feedback-based decision-making gaming (SF-DMG) approach. It instantly checked students’ decisions and provided feedback during the game to help them really understand the factors underlying each decision. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, this study adopted a quasi-experimental design and applied it in a Civic and Society course in a senior high school. The experimental group adopted the SF-DMG approach, while the control group adopted the conventional decision-making gaming (C-DMG) approach. The results showed that in comparison with the control group, the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in civic literacy, learning motivation, problem-solving tendencies, and critical thinking awareness. Besides, through the behavioral pattern analysis, it was found that with the immediate feedback on knowledge, the experimental group had better reflection and ability to modify their behaviors when facing the problems.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) assessment is crucial for testing the effectiveness of CT skills development. However, the exploration of CT assessment in the context of text-based programming is in its initial stages. The intrinsic relationship between the core skills of text-based programming and the core elements of CT isn’t analyzed in depth in the CT assessment. This shortfall hinders the construction of a more scientific and effective CT assessment model for evaluating college students’ CT skills. In this paper, we established the mapping relationship between the core skills of text-based programming and the core elements of CT through a comprehensive analysis and reasoned arguments, and proposed a CT assessment model that includes a parsing layer, a mapping layer, and a measurement layer. The parsing layer is designed to extract implicit programming skills from the program code. The mapping layer aligns the programming skills with the core elements of CT based on predefined mapping rules. The measurement layer processes data from the mapping layer using normalization methods to derive CT assessment results. In the final analysis, 52 college students’ CT skills and sample code were analyzed through text-based programming tasks. The CT assessment results, subjected to the test analysis, revealed that the consistency test ICC coefficient was 0.684 (95% CI: 0.507 ~ 0.806) and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.845. This indicates that the proposed assessment model in this paper is applicable for evaluating college students’ CT skills, and the assessment results exhibit high scientific validity and credibility. This study can serve as a valuable reference for researching the relationship between programming behavior and CT skills.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as a valuable skill set for the students of the 21st century, fostering problem-solving skills applicable to academic disciplines and everyday problems. Assessing CT involves evaluating the development of its concepts, practices, and perspectives. However, establishing comprehensive and validated assessments across different educational levels remains challenging. The Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt) is a validated tool for assessing CT concepts among primary school students, especially during their first grades (ages 5 to 10). This paper describes the translation, cultural adaptation, and psychometric validation of the BCTt for use with Greek students. The translation process involved both forward and backward translation, while the validity assessment included content and construct validity. The psychometric properties of the adapted scale were also evaluated using Item Difficulty Index, Item Discrimination Index, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. The results indicated that the Greek version of the BCTt can be used as a reliable and valid tool for assessing the CT skills among students in the three lower grades of primary school, with greater suitability for use among students in the two lower grades. Finally, our findings contribute to improving the existing assessment tools tailored to primary school students while guiding future refinement efforts to enhance overall psychometric quality.

JOUR ,,,,,"Preservice teachers often face challenges in developing Socio-emotional, Technological, and Metacognitive Knowledge (STM-K) due to a lack of effective integration of digital tools in their training. Developing STM-K is crucial for preservice teachers as it equips them with essential skills for effective teaching, such as emotional intelligence, technological proficiency, and reflective thinking, which are necessary for fostering a positive learning environment and adapting to educational innovations. This study addresses these challenges by exploring the use of electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) as an authentic assessment tool to enhance STM-K. E-portfolios allow preservice teachers to work on assignments, receive feedback, and communicate with peers and mentors without being physically present, which is particularly crucial in times of educational disruption. This study aims to foster preservice teachers’ (STM-K) using e-portfolios through a proposed framework guided by Gibbs’ reflective model. Conducted in an early childhood education program at a Federal University in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the participants (n = 112) were female preservice teachers aged 18–25 years old. An exploratory sequential mixed method design was employed to collect qualitative data (participants’ reflections) and quantitative data (participants’ surveys). The preservice teachers attended two weeks at the beginning of the semester to learn new technological applications and earn Apple Teaching Certificates. Qualitative data were analysed using Gibb’ model, and quantitative data were analysed using the q-q plot test of normality and one-sample t-test. The study’s results revealed that the preservice teachers positively nurtured their STM-K through the use of e-portfolios, benefiting from various technological applications that provide opportunities such as video, automated, and visual feedback. This study demonstrates a practical strategy for preparing teachers to effectively utilize e-portfolios by allocating time for technological training and certification at the semester’s start. The findings offer valuable insights for educational institutions and teacher education programs on integrating e-portfolios to support the STM-K of preservice teachers amidst educational challenges. Recommendations include developing an approach that integrates computer-based and human-produced feedback to capture interactions between learners, computers, instructors, and resources at different design levels.

However, less is known about how the development of each construct relates to that of the other. With a sample of 997 grade 6 students (average age = 11.43 at the beginning of the school year) from 14 primary schools, we examined the co-development of students’ CT concepts and practices based on the research method commonly used in the literature on conceptual and procedural knowledge for studying the relations between the two constructs. We first designed an instrument to measure CT concepts using an evidence-based approach, and validated it through item response theory. By applying multidimensional item response theory, we confirmed the four dimensions of CT practices using an instrument applied in a previous study. We found that after one year of CT learning, the students had improved in terms of both concepts and practices, indicating the effectiveness of the CT intervention. Structural equation modelling indicated that CT concepts and practices facilitated each other’s development; practices played a particularly important role in facilitating the development of CT. Our study provides solid evidence for the importance of the problem-solving aspect of CT as reflected in the dimension of practices.

Employing a cross-sectional design, we conducted an online survey with 870 Taiwanese university students, who had an average age of 22.81 years. The study found that inert thinking was positively associated with both positive experiences with ChatGPT and ChatGPT dependence. Furthermore, a significant association was found between inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation. Positive experience with ChatGPT was also positively related to avoidance learning motivation and ChatGPT dependence. Due to the scarcity of empirical research on generative artificial intelligence, the issues that people worry about when discussing AI were confirmed in this study. Moreover, avoidance learning motivation was positively correlated with ChatGPT dependence. Based on these findings, this study calls for educators to help students overcome inert thinking and avoidance learning motivation to prevent dependency on emerging technologies.

JOUR ,,,,,"Digital literacy is essential for scientific literacy in a digital world. Although the NGSS Practices include many activities that require digital literacy, most studies have examined digital literacy from a generic perspective rather than a curricular context. This study aimed to develop a self-report tool to measure elements of digital literacy among middle and high school students in the context of science practice. Using Messick's validity framework, Rasch analysis was conducted to ensure the tool's validity. Initial items were developed from the NGSS, KSES, and other countries' curricula and related research literature. The final 38 items were expertly reviewed by scientists and applied to 1194 students for statistical analysis. The results indicated that the tool could be divided into five dimensions of digital literacy in the context of science practice: collecting and recording data, analyzing and interpreting (statistics), analyzing and interpreting (tools), generating conclusions, and sharing and presenting. Item fit and reliability were analyzed. The study found that most items did not show significant gender or school level differences, but scores increased with grade level. Boys tended to perform better than girls, and this difference did not change with grade level. Analysis and Interpretation (Tools) showed the largest differences across school levels. The developed measurement tool suggests that digital literacy in the context of science practice is distinct from generic digital literacy, requiring a multi-contextual approach to teaching. Furthermore, the gender gap was evident in all areas and did not decrease with higher school levels, particularly in STEM-related items like math and computational languages, indicating a need for focused education for girls. The tool developed in this study can serve as a baseline for teachers to identify students' levels and for students to set learning goals.

JOUR ,,,,,"The global shortage of skilled programmers remains a persistent challenge. High dropout rates in introductory programming courses pose a significant obstacle to graduation. Previous studies highlighted learning difficulties in programming students, but their specific weaknesses remained unclear. This gap exists due to the predominant focus on the overall academic performance evaluation. To address this gap, this study employed cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM) to profile the skill mastery of programming students. An empirical analysis was conducted to select the most appropriate model for the data, and the linear logistic model (LLM) was determined to be the best fit. Final examination results from 308 information technology (IT) and 279 computer science (CS) students were analyzed using the LLM. Unfortunately, findings revealed that programming students exhibited proficiency primarily in code tracing and language proficiency but displayed deficits in theoretical understanding, logical reasoning, and algorithmic thinking. From a practical standpoint, this deficiency in fundamental skills sheds light on the factors contributing to academic failures and potentially eventual dropout in programming education. When comparing the student population by academic program, CS students demonstrated superior mastery compared to their IT counterparts, although both groups exhibited a lack of mastery in code tracing. These deviations underscore the pressing need for tailored educational strategies that address the unique strengths and weaknesses of each student group.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is widely recognized as a fundamental skill in the information age. However, within the context of Chinese early childhood education (ECE), CT remains underrepresented, with a notable gap in the availability of developmentally appropriate and rigorously validated assessment tools designed specifically for kindergartners. To address this gap, this study adapted the TechCheck-K CT assessment (Relkin & Bers, 2021) for the Chinese context and investigate individual differences in CT among children aged 4–6. The psychometric properties of TechCheck-K were evaluated through several stages. 10 experts from diverse disciplines were invited to evaluate the content validity of the tool. A pilot test involving 56 children was conducted to evaluate their levels of engagement and emotional responses during testing. Modifications and refinements were made based on the feedback and practical considerations. In the main study, which involved 270 children, the tool’s validity, reliability, and item characteristics were examined using factor analysis, classical test theory, item response theory, and a follow-up test. The results indicated that the assessment was easy to administer in kindergarten settings and demonstrated sufficient validity and reliability. Item analyses revealed that the test items showed acceptable discriminability, difficulty, and possibility of guessing. Furthermore, K3 children achieved significantly higher CT scores than K2 children, while no significant gender differences were found.

Four different scaffolding conditions were provided to help learners optimize cognitive load and improve their problem-solving abilities. A total of 110 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. The four-week experiment included scaffolding, with two hours of Python programming each week to solve two real-world problems. Upon completing the learning process, participants’ cognitive load and problem-solving skills were assessed. The results provide empirical evidence that using faded worked examples (WOE) combined with metacognitive scaffolding for CT effectively optimizes cognitive load and enhances problem-solving skills in collaborative programming, leading to improved efficiency and complexity in their solutions.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study developed a school-based AI curriculum suitable for senior high school students, with the primary objective of enhancing their mastery of knowledge and proficiency in AI, as well as their computational thinking abilities. The curriculum was designed with an awareness of the practical challenges encountered by the subject school in their implementation of AI education, while also adhering to the guidelines for AI curriculum outlined in the General Senior High School Curriculum Standards: Information Technology. Building on this foundation, the curriculum objectives were proposed. The curriculum modules were meticulously developed, informed by the insights gained from student surveys and interviews with teachers. Subsequently, a teaching experiment was implemented in a high school, employing a combination of engaging lectures and project-based learning methodologies. Following this, a quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate variations in students’ computational thinking. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, which included an examination to assess students' mastery of AI-related concepts and theories, project evaluation forms to investigate and evaluate students’ computational thinking processes, and a questionnaire to statistically analyze students' satisfaction with the curriculum. Through these measures, the effectiveness of the school-based AI curriculum was verified from multiple perspectives. The results confirmed the curriculum's effectiveness in enhancing students' computational thinking, particularly in algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. When compared to traditional AI teaching methods based on the Information Technology curriculum, the school-based AI curriculum demonstrated a more pronounced effectiveness in cultivating these competencies, with students showing significant improvements in problem analysis, solving, and knowledge transfer, alongside high satisfaction levels. This study provided a compelling case of school-based AI education in senior high schools, expecting to inspire educators' teaching practice in AI education and to catalyze the development of computational thinking across K-12 learning environments.

The review focused on the research methods, educational technologies, interactions, student group formation, and research outcomes. The findings revealed that the most used research method was quantitative, followed by the mixed-method approach, and most participants were undergraduates, followed by junior high school students. Most studies used interactive technologies in implementing CSCL, followed by web-based tools, Learning Management Systems (LMS), social media, and video conferencing. Six types of interaction were found among instructor, learner, content, and interface. The most applied student group formation technique was group attributes selection with the random selection method, followed by students’ self-selection and teachers’ selection, while few studies used member attributes based on students’ personal traits and students’ knowledge/competence. Regarding research outcomes, the students’ perceptions were the most observed dependent variable, followed by students’ knowledge gain, students’ group task performance, and students’ social interaction. Surprisingly, students’ critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving skills were found to be relatively understudied.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the context of globalization, adapting to modern educational needs and adopting innovative teaching methods have become increasingly crucial, particularly in the field of children’s aesthetic education. This study explores the integration of scaffolding instruction and AI-driven diffusion models in children’s aesthetic education, with a special focus on teaching the traditional Chinese cultural concept of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms. The study develops a specialized dataset for traditional Chinese paintings of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms and introduces a novel compound loss function to optimize the AI models’ training process, thus enhancing the quality of instructional image resources. A scaffolding teaching framework, supported by an AI-driven diffusion model, is established to provide systematic and structured guidance tailored to children’s learning needs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly enhances students’ engagement and comprehension of traditional cultural concepts. Specifically, students demonstrated a deeper understanding of the symbolic and artistic meanings embedded in the Twenty-Four Solar Terms, which leads to enhanced cultural appreciation and critical thinking. Moreover, the approach fostered active participation in learning activities, with students exhibiting increased interaction with the educational content. These improvements were particularly evident in the way students creatively interpreted cultural symbols and applied these concepts in their own artistic expressions. This study confirms the potential of AI-driven diffusion models to support more effective teaching practices in aesthetic education, offering valuable insights for integrating modern technology with traditional cultural education and providing key theoretical and practical references for future reforms in children’s aesthetic education. These findings possess significant practical implications, particularly within the education domain. The proposed AI-driven scaffolding teaching method can be broadly applied to classroom instruction in traditional Chinese painting, and it can also be extended to other domains, namely cultural and art education. By generating high-quality instructional image resources, the approach empowers educators to implement personalized teaching strategies in classrooms with diverse cultural backgrounds, while simultaneously enhancing students’ cultural understanding and creativity. Furthermore, for distance and online education, the method possesses a potentially broad application scope, equipping educators with an effective tool for facilitating educational reform and innovation.

Generative artificial intelligence dialogic feedback (GenAIDF) has the potential to enhance learners’ experience through dialogue, but its effectiveness remains sufficiently underexplored in empirical research. This study employed a rigorous quasi-experimental design and collected multidimensional data through mixed methods to investigate the impact of GenAIDF at different stages of programming problem-solving on high school students’ programming skills and critical thinking. One hundred seventy-two high school students from four distinct classes participated in this study. We established three experimental groups, introducing GenAIDF during the code writing (CAG, NCAG = 43), verification debugging (DAG, NDAG = 43), and both code writing and verification debugging (CDAG, NCDAG = 43) stages, and one control group, without GenAIDF introduced at any stage (NAG, NNAG = 43). The results indicated that, first, in terms of programming skills, the three experimental groups exhibited no significant difference in their programming knowledge, yet they significantly outperformed the control group. CAG excelled in programming project performance, while DAG excelled in structure. CDAG excelled in functions but had poor plagiarism scores. Second, regarding critical thinking skills, DAG performed best, followed by CAG, CDAG, and NAG, with significant differences observed among the four groups. Finally, student interviews revealed increased learning engagement, satisfaction, and critical thinking consciousness. Based on these findings, the study provides empirical recommendations for teachers on effectively utilizing GenAIDF in the future.

This study aims to explore the relationship between Information and Communications Technology (ICT literacy) and secondary school students’ computational thinking skills in smart classroom environments. This study adopts clustered sampling approach to select 351 students from 8 secondary schools in H Province of China as a valid sample. This study uses questionnaire survey to collect data, which mainly includes two scales, ICT literacy and computational thinking skills. Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were adopted to analyze this survey data. The results showed that ICT literacy has a significant positive impact on secondary school students’ computational thinking skills. From the calculation results of the model, the three sub-components of ICT literacy have different impacts on secondary school students’ computational thinking with internet literacy being the most important component, followed by computer literacy and information literacy. Given this interweaving of ICT literacy and computational thinking skills, it is conceivable to state that developing students’ ICT literacy could play a significant role in ensuring that appropriate measures are taken to improve computational thinking skills.

Research suggests that different game elements in DGBL may elicit varying levels of motivation and affect outcomes. In a digital game designed for CT learning, this study examined the complex relationship among rewards, competition, motivation, and learning outcomes. Data were collected from 216 secondary school students across ten different classes, who were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: power-up rewards with competition, power-up rewards only, customization rewards with competition, customization rewards only, and a control condition with no rewards or competition. Regression analysis revealed that power-up rewards impacted CT learning indirectly by reducing tension, although they did not directly influence motivation or CT outcomes. Customization rewards showed no significant effects on motivation or CT outcomes. Although competition alone did not significantly influence motivation or CT outcomes, its combination with power-up rewards weakened CT outcomes compared with power-up rewards alone without competition. The study suggests that competition may dilute the positive effects of rewards, emphasizing the need for careful integration of reward structures in DGBL. The study provides valuable insights for designing DGBL interventions that balance rewards and competition while minimizing tension to achieve optimal learning outcomes.

In computer programming education, efforts are underway to explore how this tool can enhance instructional practices. Despite the growing literature, there is a lack of synthesis on its use in this field. This rapid review addresses this gap by examining the current literature to outline research trends, assess how it supports teaching and learning processes, and discern the issues that emerge from its application in programming instruction. A total of 107 documents disseminated across 81 distinct sources and authored by 394 contributors were identified. The review adopted a broad and inclusive approach, selecting literature based on relevance to ChatGPT's application in programming education and encompassing studies from diverse settings and methodologies. Results highlight applications such as personalized tutoring, knowledge reinforcement, instructional material creation, source code generation, immediate feedback, and assessment support. However, its use also introduces challenges such as academic dishonesty, ethical dilemmas, diminished critical thinking, overdependence on ChatGPT, and various technical limitations. Considering these findings, a balanced approach to the utilization of ChatGPT in programming education is essential.

Early computational thinking skills are found in common early childhood activities. This paper identifies activities teachers can use in the classroom to explicitly promote children’s computational thinking and provides a new perspective on how to adapt classroom activities to integrate computational thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is an important twenty-first century skill that begins developing early. Recent interest in incorporating early CT experiences in early childhood education (i.e., preschool) has increased. In fact, the early years mark an important time during which initial competencies are acquired, interest and motivation begins to form, and in which children may develop a sense of belonging in STEM fields. As a result, providing children with access to robotics and computer science experiences to support CT that are also developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant is key. This paper uses the “powerful ideas” of computer science, seven developmentally appropriate CT concepts that children can learn, as a framework and explores the experiences of two (composite) teachers who participated in and co-developed a culturally relevant robotics program and the processes they undertake to support children’s CT development and learning. This paper considers practices that support the seven key powerful ideals while leveraging existing instructional routines and contexts that are already occurring in most classrooms, such as centers, small group activities, classroom environments, and read-alouds. Of note, this paper prioritizes approaches that acknowledge, center, and feature the ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds of young children and their families.

JOUR ,,,,,"Many students persistently misinterpret histograms. This calls for closer inspection of students’ strategies when interpreting histograms and case-value plots (which look similar but are different). Using students’ gaze data, we ask: How and how well do upper secondary pre-university school students estimate and compare arithmetic means of histograms and case-value plots? We designed four item types: two requiring mean estimation and two requiring means comparison. Analysis of gaze data of 50 students (15–19 years old) solving these items was triangulated with data from cued recall. We found five strategies. Two hypothesized most common strategies for estimating means were confirmed: a strategy associated with horizontal gazes and a strategy associated with vertical gazes. A third, new, count-and-compute strategy was found. Two more strategies emerged for comparing means that take specific features of the distribution into account. In about half of the histogram tasks, students used correct strategies. Surprisingly, when comparing two case-value plots, some students used distribution features that are only relevant for histograms, such as symmetry. As several incorrect strategies related to how and where the data and the distribution of these data are depicted in histograms, future interventions should aim at supporting students in understanding these concepts in histograms.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this paper, we are interested in a dynamic vision of diagrams, focusing on their evocative power, their force in mathematical activity and their potential for interaction with mathematical objects. We are inspired by the work of C. S. Pierce to see diagrams as inscriptions that organise space and articulate relations and that of the philosopher of mathematics G. Châtelet that emphasises diagrams as the very means of ontogenesis. In particular, diagrams are sophisticated mathematical devices for thinking about and communicating mathematics. They have stories and purposes. Focus is on the use of diagrams in the mathematics classroom to tell stories in order to trigger narrative modes of thinking (a là Bruner) as part of the mathematical work. Through some examples from the written productions of students at different ages, we examine how the task of telling a story about a given diagram gives rise to multiple views of the diagram. We use this analysis to begin characterising ways in which the mathematical relationships embedded in a diagram acquire a character that is both affective and aesthetic and to suggest implications of such use of diagrams in and for mathematics education.

JOUR ,,,,,"The feature-matching approach pioneered by Amos Tversky remains a groundwork for psychological models of similarity and categorization but is rarely explicitly justified considering recent advances in thinking about cognition. While psychologists often view similarity as an unproblematic foundational concept that explains generalization and conceptual thought, long-standing philosophical problems challenging this assumption suggest that similarity derives from processes of higher-level cognition, including inference and conceptual thought. This paper addresses three specific challenges to Tversky’s approach: (i) the feature-selection problem, (ii) the problem of cognitive implausibility, and (iii) the problem of unprincipled tweaking. It subsequently supports key insights from Tversky’s account based on recent developments in Bayesian modeling of cognition. A novel computational view of similarity as inference is proposed that addresses each challenge by considering the contrast class as constitutive of similarity and selecting for highly informative features. In so doing, this view illustrates the ongoing promise of the feature-matching approach in explaining perception, generalization and conceptual thought by grounding them in principles of probabilistic inference.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the context of the conceptual spaces framework, it has been argued that a natural concept is represented by a convex region in a similarity space. The convexity requirement has been defended on grounds of cognitive economy: among other benefits, concepts represented by convex regions have been said to be easily learnable, or more easily than concepts represented by nonconvex regions. There is some evidence that concepts in use are represented by regions that are convex, or at least almost so. There is so far no evidence that concepts represented by convex regions are more easily learnable than ones represented by regions that satisfy topological criteria that are somewhat less stringent, most notably that of connectedness. This note presents the outcomes from computational studies carried out on perceptual color space as well as on a shape space for representing various container objects, indicating that convexity indeed facilitates learning more than does connectedness. The studies use the training of neural nets as a model of human learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper analyses the phenomenology and epistemology of chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bard. The computational architecture underpinning these chatbots are large language models (LLMs), which are generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems trained on a massive dataset of text extracted from the Web. We conceptualise these LLMs as multifunctional computational cognitive artifacts, used for various cognitive tasks such as translating, summarizing, answering questions, information-seeking, and much more. Phenomenologically, LLMs can be experienced as a “quasi-other”; when that happens, users anthropomorphise them. For most users, current LLMs are black boxes, i.e., for the most part, they lack data transparency and algorithmic transparency. They can, however, be phenomenologically and informationally transparent, in which case there is an interactional flow. Anthropomorphising and interactional flow can, in some users, create an attitude of (unwarranted) trust towards the output LLMs generate. We conclude this paper by drawing on the epistemology of trust and testimony to examine the epistemic implications of these dimensions. Whilst LLMs generally generate accurate responses, we observe two epistemic pitfalls. Ideally, users should be able to match the level of trust that they place in LLMs to the degree that LLMs are trustworthy. However, both their data and algorithmic opacity and their phenomenological and informational transparency can make it difficult for users to calibrate their trust correctly. The effects of these limitations are twofold: users may adopt unwarranted attitudes of trust towards the outputs of LLMs (which is particularly problematic when LLMs hallucinate), and the trustworthiness of LLMs may be undermined.

JOUR ,,,,,"More than 1300 new buildings over 200 m tall have been built since the year 2000, representing 80% of the total number of supertall buildings globally. The proliferation of such challenging architecture in densely populated urban environments has led engineers to question the fitness of the prevalent prescriptive approaches in ensuring the safety of occupants in the event of a fire. This paper proposes a more rational methodology to estimate scientifically appropriate boundary conditions to represent realistic fire scenarios on the structure for more credible simulation of the consequent structural response using an integrated computational tool. An open-source framework, “OpenFIRE” is developed to implement the methodology. OpenFIRE is capable of simulating the whole sequence i.e., development of a fire scenario, heat transfer to the structure, and the thermomechanical response of the structure, through a sequential coupling of CFD tools with FE software. OpenFIRE exploits the capabilities of available tools such as FDS and OpenSEES and integrates them to produce a free, efficient, and open source computational framework which allows to customise and modify the source codes. It can bring structural fire community a step closer towards the adoption of performance-based designs. This framework is validated by comparing the thermal and structural responses of a square hollow section (SHS) steel column under fire with the experimental data. The critical parameters of the fire scenario produced by the framework are found in close agreement with the experimental data. The thermal and structural responses of the SHS column exposed to the developed fire scenario are also validated with test results in terms of structural temperatures, failure modes, and failure load.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article has two general aims. It first of all critically reconsiders the empirical turn’s dismissal of transcendentalism in the philosophy of technology, in particular through the work of Ihde and Verbeek, and defends the continuing relevance of the notion of the transcencental in thinking about technology today, illustrating this mainly through a reading of Stiegler’s understanding of the human condition as a technical condition and his view of human (noetic) evolution as proceeding from a process of technical exteriorization. The crucial issue that is missed by postphenomenology and the empirical turn is that technology itself in its empiricity occupies the (periodically changing) place of the transcendental. It thus fails to consider the transcendental operativity of technical artifacts within its own empiricist stance. Secondly, it argues for the continuing importance and usefulness of the idea of Technology with a capital T, equally discarded by the representatives of the empirical turn, in particular against the emerging backdrop of the Anthropocene as the age of decisive anthropogenic forcing of the planet and the growing dominance of what has recently been called the technosphere in Earth system science. With Stiegler I show that a proper, inherent dynamic of technology must be acknowledged historically, anthropologically, techno-evolutionarily as well as (techno)phenomenologically. I conclude by demonstrating that our time of planetary crisis summons us to redirect our attention to technology from the empirical to the transcendental, and from the micro-level to the macro-level again.

An explanation of computation that does not take this semiotic dimension into account is incomplete. Semiosis is essential to computation and therefore requires a rigorous definition. To prove this thesis, the author analyzes two concepts of computation: the Turing machine and the mechanistic conception of physical computation. The paper is organized in two parts. The first part (Sects. 2 and 3) develops a re-interpretation of the Turing machine starting from Peirce’s semiotics. The author shows how this reinterpretation allows overcoming the dualism between a purist and a realist version of the Turing machine. The second part of the paper (Sect. 4) shows how a mechanistic explanation of physical computation such as the one developed by Piccinini is incomplete without considering semiotic relations.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this paper I offer an introduction to group field theory (GFT) and to some of the issues affecting the foundations of this approach to quantum gravity. I first introduce covariant GFT as the theory that one obtains by interpreting the amplitudes of certain spin foam models as Feynman amplitudes in a perturbative expansion. However, I argue that it is unclear that this definition of GFTs amounts to something beyond a computational rule for finding these transition amplitudes and that GFT doesn’t seem able to offer any new insight into the foundations of quantum gravity. Then, I move to another formulation of GFT which I call canonical GFT and which uses the standard structures of quantum mechanics. This formulation is of extended use in cosmological applications of GFT, but I argue that it is only heuristically connected with the covariant version and spin foam models. Moreover, I argue that this approach is affected by a version of the problem of time which raises worries about its viability. Therefore, I conclude that there are serious concerns about the justification and interpretation of GFT in either version of it.

JOUR ,,,,,"Participatory modeling (PM) is a craft that is often learned by training ‘on the job’ and mastered through years of practice. There is little explicit knowledge available on identifying and documenting the skills needed to perform PM. In the modeling literature, existing attempts to identify relevant competencies have focused on the specific technical skills required for specific technical model development. The other skills required to organize and conduct the stakeholder process seem to be more vaguely and poorly defined in this context. The situation is complicated by PM being an essentially transdisciplinary craft, with no single discipline or skill set to borrow ideas and recommendations from. In this paper, we aim to set the foundation for both the practice and capacity-building efforts for PM by identifying the relevant core competencies. Our inquiry into this topic starts with reviewing and compiling literature on competencies in problem-solving research areas related to PM (e.g., systems thinking, facilitated model building, operations research, and so forth). We augment our inquiry with results from a PM practitioners’ survey to learn how they perceive the importance of different competencies and how the scope of these competencies may vary across the various roles that participatory modellers play. As a result, we identified five core competency areas essential for PM: systems thinking, modeling, group facilitation, project management and leadership, and, more recently, designing and running virtual workshops and events.

We analyzed all course descriptions from 1169 tertiary educational programmes at all higher educational institutions spanning all of Denmark.

JOUR ,,,,,"Hubert Dreyfus once noted that it would be difficult to ascertain whether Edmund Husserl had a computational theory of mind. I provide evidence that he had one. Both Steven Pinker and Steven Horst think that the computational theory of mind must have two components: a representational-symbolic component and a causal component. Bearing this in mind, we proceed to a close-reading of the sections of “On the Logic of Signs” wherein Husserl presents, if I’m correct, his computational theory of mind embedded in a language of thought. My argument goes like this: the computational theory of mind is the idea, following Haugeland, that the mind comes prepackaged as, or is endogenously constrained to be (with respect to certain domains), an automatic formal system; this explains, according to Husserl, why automatic trains of thought without logical intent resemble arguments exhibiting deductive structure with logical intent. In general, an automatic formal system yields true results provided that (1) the syntactic symbols with which they compute are univocal and are semantically evaluable, and (2) the mechanized inferences they perform are valid and preserve truth. These two conditions describe a computational (as opposed to an associative) cognitive process: the first condition connects representations to syntax (corresponding to Pinker and Horst’s first component), and the second condition uses the syntax, in inauthentic judging, to arrive at true conclusions through blind causality (corresponding to Pinker and Horst’s second component). Now, in point of textual fact, these are the conditions which Husserl attributes to our “natural psychological mechanism of symbolic inference” which typically yields true results. Since a formal system attributed to the “internal structure” of the mind, and guided by blind causality, just is the computational theory of mind, it follows, I think, that Husserl had a computational theory of mind. This computational theory is, moreover, embedded in a language of thought, since Husserl attributes a language-like form to our thoughts so that they may be mechanically processed. I conclude with a discussion of my results.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill. This paper aims at more useful CT assessment. Available evaluation instruments are reviewed; two generally accepted CT evaluation tools are selected for a comprehensive CT assessment: the CTt, a performance test, and the CTS, a self-assessment instrument. The sample comprises 202 high school students from German-speaking Switzerland. Concerning the CTt, Rasch-scalability is demonstrated. Utilizing the approach of the PISA studies, proficiency levels are formed that comprise tasks with specific characteristics that students are systematically able to master. This could help teachers to offer individual support to their students. In terms of the CTS, the original version is refined using confirmatory factor and measurement-invariance analysis. A latent profile analysis yielded four profiles, two of which are of particular interest.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the pre-service teachers’ computational thinking (CT) skills and self-efficacy (SE) towards teaching CT, who attended a course in which educational games were developed in a block-based programming environment and lesson plans were prepared accordingly. The research was conducted with thirty seven pre-service teachers who took the instructional technologies course. The convergent parallel mixed method was used in this study. Accordingly, quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest was applied in the quantitative part, and thematic analysis was conducted in the qualitative part. The implementation process was carried out in three stages. In the first stage, pre-service teachers gained awareness about the components of CT and established applications about algorithm writing and Scratch. In the second stage, pre-service teachers developed Scratch-based games related to their subjecs areas. In the third stage, they prepared lesson plans teaching CT skills by using the games that they developed. The quantitative findings of the study showed that pre-service teachers’ CT and SE perceptions towards its teaching increased significantly. This increase had a weak effect on the CT skill and a large effect on the SE perception regarding the teaching of this skill. It was concluded that the qualitative findings support the quantitative findings. Pre-service teachers stated that the implementation process contributed to their CT skills and SE towards its teaching. In addition, the implementation process contributed to their professional competencies, including technological and pedagogical knowledge.

For all youth to have hands-on opportunities to develop essential computational thinking skills, libraries and informal learning environments play a critical role. This is especially true for youth who attend schools where computational learning opportunities are limited or altogether absent. This article presents an analysis of responses from 59 library staff members to the following questions: What is computational thinking? How is computational thinking being facilitated in libraries? And, what are the goals of the computational thinking programs being offered by libraries? The analysis reveals the multifaceted ways that library staff conceptualize computational thinking and the range of ways computational thinking is being integrated into library programs. This work advances our understanding of the current state of computational thinking in libraries. In doing so, we seek to guide library staff on ways to support the computational thinking learning that is currently happening and create new ways to help bring the powerful ideas of computing to broader audiences.

JOUR ,,,,,"Since teaching robotics in schools is still new for teachers, studies on how to integrate computational thinking concepts in robotics courses are still rare. In this direction, teacher training sessions for teaching robotics should be visited. Accordingly, in this exploratory case study, a professional development program for teachers was suggested for teaching computational thinking (CT) by using virtual educational robotics. After constructing and delivering the instructional package to six high school computer science teachers, we assessed their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) development with the assessment tools created through the indicators of integrating CT in robotics. We also monitored two of the teachers in the real classrooms. The results of the study showed that the computer science teachers’ content knowledge (CK) about robotics and CT, and also their PCK to integrate CK in robotics positively improved at sufficient and advanced levels. The fact that the CK was considered as the joint of CT and robotics provided important clues in organizing the training sessions in the context of integrating CT into robotics teaching. Activities about daily life problems, training techniques such as peer assessment, authentic lesson plans, and micro-teaching activities were prominent factors that positively contributed to the development of teachers’ CK and PCK. Structuring the feedback within the framework of CT in the training positively contributed to the teachers’ CK developments in terms of CT and robotics. Guiding teachers to exhibit their teaching roles by presenting concrete examples for individual and collaborative robotics activities also supported the development of teachers' PCK. The implications for course designers desiring to provide a better teaching experience for the teachers teaching CT via robotics were also included.

JOUR ,,,,,"The recent popularity of computational thinking (CT) and the desire to apply CT in our daily lives have prompted the need for a successful pedagogical technique for learning CT in K-12 education. The application of co-design pedagogical techniques has the potential to improve students’ CT learning through knowledge sharing and the creation of ideas to solve problems and develop an artifact. However, there is a limited understanding of how co-design pedagogical techniques have been explored to foster CT learning, which could hamper the successful use of co-design as a pragmatic teaching approach. This study examined the ways in which co-design pedagogical techniques have been applied in CT education by implementing a systematic literature review (PRISMA protocol) to document the review analysis. A total of 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study were reviewed. Findings in this study revealed that workshops are the most utilized co-design learning setting and, as expected, the collaborative technique is the co-design pedagogical technique most frequently adopted for implementing CT in K-12 education. NetLogo is the most frequently used co-design tool for teaching and learning CT in K-12 education, and an interdependence exists between NetLogo and the Common Online Data Analysis Platform. Co-design also helps teachers develop the ability to use co-design pedagogical techniques to learn, create content, and integrate CT into their various subjects. This study contributes to practical knowledge by unraveling and advocating the use of dialogical, prompting, framing, and game-based techniques as co-design pedagogical techniques for K-12 teachers and also helps teachers identify useful co-design tools for learning CT.

JOUR ,,,,,"The introduction of computing education into curricula worldwide requires multi-year assessments to evaluate the long-term impact on learning. However, no single Computational Thinking (CT) assessment spans primary school, and no group of CT assessments provides a means of transitioning between instruments. This study therefore investigated whether the competent CT test (cCTt) could evaluate learning reliably from grades 3 to 6 (ages 7–11) using data from 2709 students. The psychometric analysis employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, Measurement Invariance analyses which include Differential Item Functioning, normalised z-scoring, and PISA’s methodology to establish proficiency levels. The findings indicate that the cCTt is valid, reliable and gender-fair for grades 3–6, although more complex items would be beneficial for grades 5–6. Grade-specific proficiency levels are provided to help tailor interventions, with a normalised scoring system to compare students across and between grades, and help establish transitions between instruments. To improve the utility of CT assessments among researchers, educators and practitioners, the findings emphasise the importance of (i) developing and validating gender-fair, grade-specific, instruments aligned with students’ cognitive maturation, and providing (ii) proficiency levels, and (iii) equivalency scales to transition between assessments.

In this article, we aimed to address this gap by conducting a study focused on the implementation of embodied learning specifically designed for early elementary students in CT education. Our goal was to investigate how embodied learning activities could support the learning of symbols and sequences through path-finding tasks. Throughout the study, we observed students’ embodiment in the process of learning CT, paying particular attention to their utilization of hand gestures, bodily movement, and finger-pointing. During the embodied learning activities, students actively incorporated external objects as referents at three distinct levels: concrete, analogical, and abstract. These levels corresponded to different degrees of concreteness and abstraction in their use of external objects. The results of our investigation suggest that students’ comprehension and application of CT knowledge are inherently embodied, underscoring the importance of embodied learning activities in CT education.

While most researchers are concentrating on defining CT and developing tools for its instruction and assessment, we focus on the characteristics of computational thinking problems (CTPs)- activities requiring CT to be solved-and how they influence the skills students can develop. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for systematically profiling CTPs by identifying specific components and characteristics, while establishing a link between these attributes and a structured catalogue of CT competencies. The purposes of this framework are (i) facilitating the analysis of existing CTPs to identify which abilities can be developed or measured based on their inherent characteristics, and (ii) guiding the design of new CTPs targeted at specific skills by outlining the necessary characteristics required for CT activation. To illustrate the framework functionalities, we begin by analysing prototypical activities in the literature, a process that leads to the definition of a taxonomy of CTPs across various domains, and we conclude with a case study on the design of a different version of one of these activities, the Cross Array Task (CAT), set in different cognitive environments. This approach allows an understanding of how CTPs in different contexts display unique and recurring characteristics that promote the development of distinct skills. In conclusion, this framework can inform the development of assessment tools, improve teacher training, and facilitate the analysis and comparison of existing CT activities, contributing to a deeper understanding of competency activation and guiding curriculum design in CT education.

Data was gathered via task-based questionnaires from 160 participants, evenly divided between fifth-graders and adults. Their responses to a systematically varied collection of context-free and context-based items shed light on their performance and strategies in relation to two interrelated aspects of reasonableness: number relationships and the effect of operations (internal reasonableness) and the practicality of answers (external reasonableness). The results revealed that students were better at utilising the former criterion compared to the latter, while for adults, the opposite was found. However, adults clearly outperformed students in both aspects. Task characteristics such as the involved numbers and operations, and the correctness or incorrectness of computation results, were found to be associated with fluctuations in performance, although the effect differed between context-free and context-based items. Algorithm- and rule-based strategies were more popular than sense-making ones especially among students, although only the latter type was correlated with increased correct response rates. Students often failed to obtain results that made sense considering real-life situations or the involved numbers and operations. Instead, they blindly trusted algorithms and rules, even when their use was inappropriate or insufficient. The findings highlight that to help students refine their ability to judge reasonableness, mathematics classrooms should prioritise the development of number sense and promote the search for connections between school mathematics and everyday life.

JOUR ,,,,,"Learning progressions (LPs) are cognitive models that describe the development of scientific knowledge and practices in students. They are constructed based on learning theories and student data. Scholars have advocated for using LPs to align curriculum, instruction, and assessment into a coherent system, and by doing so, promote productive learning (Duncan & Hmelo-Silver, 2009; National Research Council [NRC], 2005, 2007). Systematic validation can be used to monitor and evaluate how well LPs enhance the coherence in curriculum-instruction-assessment systems. A framework for systematic validation of LP research is presented in this article, which illustrates Kane’s argument-based validation approach (Kane, 2013) can be applied to science LP research. In the framework, an interpretation/use argument and a validity argument are established to ensure that the LP aligns curriculum, instruction, and assessment into a coherent system. The interpretation/use argument contains three claims and their assumptions. The three claims are the LP, students’ proficiency measured by the LP, and the use of the LP to inform teaching. The validity argument specifies what and how theoretical rationale and empirical evidence are obtained and used to evaluate those assumptions and hence the claims. We use the activities, data, and results from the Mathematical Thinking in Science (MTS) project to illustrate how these two arguments can be built in an iterative and progressive manner. The framework, along with our experiences and lessons learned, will be of value to other researchers as they conduct their own LP studies.

To ensure consistency in education delivery, the experimental and control groups were taught by the same cohort of teachers. The PISA-based (Program for International Student Assessment) Creative Thinking Test was used as the research instrument to evaluate the differences in creative thinking between the experimental and comparison groups. Evidence indicated that students in the experimental group with STEAM PBL outperformed their peers in the comparison group in both overall social and scientific creative thinking. Specifically, the experimental group students' ability to generate diverse ideas (GD), generate creative ideas (GC), and evaluate and improve others' ideas (EI) were significantly improved. The experimental group students can think faster and divergently (GD) and develop unique and original ideas for problem-solving (GC).

JOUR ,,,,,"Much attention has been paid to computational thinking (CT) as a problem-solving approach across various curricula, particularly in mathematics. Most studies solely used a digital instrument or examined transfer of program solving ability, neglecting the mathematics knowledge domain or how the novel digital instrument functions alongside the dominant paper-and-pencil instrument in a classroom. Using Instrument-Mediated Activity Theory, our qualitative case study compares how secondary level students appropriated computer programming (as a means of using CT) and paper-and-pencil instruments to solve mathematics textbook word problems, via the analysis of three cases. Our results show that each instrument privileged certain ways of thinking that, by extension, de-emphasized others. The finding implies that teachers seeking to introduce computational concepts should be aware of an epistemic clash arising from the long-term use of paper-and-pencil for solving mathematics problems. We suggest that a more effective way to bring CT into secondary level mathematics is to introduce new types of problems or tasks that are less likely to interfere with the dominant instrument.

The findings revealed improvements in both mathematization and verification. It was found that Scratch holds great potential for creating real-life problems and promoting mathematical thinking. By engaging with Scratch-based problems, students were able to generalize mathematical procedures and operations, benefiting from its representational affordances and the power of coding.

JOUR ,,,,,"As science education shifts toward integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) approaches, guidelines for designing teaching and learning episodes that integrate curricular content and procedures from multiple disciplines become increasingly in demand. The existing plethora of conceptualizations of STEM makes difficult such an endeavor, leading to ill-defined lesson plans focused on only two –mainly science and technology or science and mathematics– out of the four STEM disciplines. The question addressed, therefore, is how the integrated STEM approach could be translated into classroom practices that integrate the four STEM disciplines in a way that is consistent and coherent with elementary education curricula. This manuscript advances a theoretically informed didactic model for the design and implementation of integrated STEM in elementary education. The article discusses how the model uses socio-constructivist principles to establish intentional and explicit connections between STEM disciplines via scientific inquiry, engineering design, and computational thinking practices. The model is rooted in learning theories developed by Piaget, Vygotsky, Ausubel, and Bruner and could serve as a roadmap for educators and researchers designing integrated STEM lessons. Future empirical research testing the model is warranted.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study investigates the development of algorithmic thinking as a part of computational thinking skills and self-efficacy of primary school pupils using programmable robots in different instruction variants. Computational thinking is defined in the context of twenty-first century skills and describes processes involved in (re)formulating a problem in a way that a computer can process it. Programming robots offers specific affordances as it can be used to develop programs following a Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) cycle. The literature provides evidence that programming robots has the potential to enhance algorithmic thinking as a component of computational thinking. Specifically there are indications that pupils who use SRA-programming learn algorithmic skills better and achieve a higher level of self-efficacy in an open, scaffold learning environment than through direct instruction. In order to determine the influence of the instruction variant used, an experimental research design was made in which pupils solved algorithm-based mathematical problems (grid diagrams) in a preliminary measurement and their self-efficacy determined via a questionnaire. As an intervention, pupils learn to solve programming issues in pairs using “Lego NXT” robots and “Mindstorms” software in two instruction variants. The post-measurement consists of a Lego challenge, solving mathematical problems (grid diagrams), and a repeated self-efficacy questionnaire. This research shows an increase of our measures on algorithmic thinking dependent on the amount of SRA usage (though not significant). Programming using the SRA-cycle can be considered as the cause of the measured effect. The instruction variant used during the robotic intervention seems to play only a marginal role.

JOUR ,,,,,"Just as engineering and computational thinking have recently gained increased attention in pre-college school-based education, many museums and science centers have also designed exhibits and experiences to promote computational thinking and engineering learning. Recent reports suggest that computational and engineering thinking can empower each other, and engineering design can be an appropriate context for children’s engagement in computational thinking. Previous studies have documented young children’s abilities to engage in engineering thinking and other studies have collected evidence of young children’s abilities to engage in computational thinking. However, there is little research that explores how children’s engagement in both engineering and computational thinking can support each other. Hence, in this qualitative case study, we aimed to examine how 5 to 7-year-old children engage in computational thinking competencies in the context of a family based engineering design activity. This activity was conducted at a small science center exhibit. In our presented findings we map children’s enactment of at least one CT competency to children’s engagement in engineering design actions. ",,,"Cardella, Monica E.

JOUR ,,,,,"Many teaching in higher education whose fields rely heavily on processes using technology can be overwhelmed by the pace of developments, and, in turn, have difficulties identifying those competencies necessary for their students to have mastered. These educators may feel as though they are aiming at a moving target, and given the number of new platforms and communication tactics, this target could seem increasingly distant. One such field greatly impacted by rapidly developing technology is interior design, wherein practitioners are increasingly leveraging tactics that promise newfound fidelity, interoperability, and greater production speed. However, it is unclear how these advancements may influence the expectations for entry-level designers—and by extension—the curricula of design educators. The purpose of this research was to apply a Systems Thinking approach to determine technology’s influence on both the design process and the production of deliverables. Data was gathered from design practitioners surrounding the variety of software and technological applications used during four phases of the design process (e.g., schematic, design development, construction documents, and construction administration). To determine adoption trends, these responses were compared to previous data from Dyar and Huber (in: Sarawgi (ed) Interior design educators annual national council, Fort Worth, TX, Interior Design Educators Council, Chicago, 2015). Responses were analyzed with descriptive crosstabs and inferential statistics, including T-tests, Analysis of Variance, and posthoc Tukey’s Range Tests. The findings suggest that expectations for students, and consequently, their instructors, are evolving rapidly. While this study is rooted in interior design, its methodology and its implications may prove valuable to allied design fields.

JOUR ,,,,,"Evaluating novelty in design education is subjective and generally depends on expert’s referential metrics. Presently, practitioners in this field perform subjective evaluation of answers of prospective students, but many a time, humans are prone to errors when associated with repetitive tasks on large-scale. Therefore, this paper attempts to automate the process of evaluating novelty by a proposed computational model. The present study explores design aptitude to evaluate novelty in solutions provided by students in an examination. Mixed-methods research is conducted based on structured questionnaire and analysis to investigate features of subjective evaluation of novelty practiced for evaluation in design education. The survey resulted in features that closely resemble human evaluation strategies for evaluating novelty from descriptive solutions. Further, a computational model is proposed, designed, and implemented that evaluates novelty. Scores are generated for each feature by unsupervised learning techniques, eventually calculating novelty score by a scoring function. This model suggests unambiguous scores to solutions, which might help in a consistent selection of students aspiring admission to design schools. This study attempts to reduce pain points of educational practitioners by offering a voluntary automated technique for subjective evaluation and optimize trustworthiness of students in examination process. In future, this model can be extended for evaluating any other domain of interest. ",,,"Yammiyavar, Pradeep G.

Forty primary school students and one dedicated robotics teacher participated in this research, while 32 students and the teacher completed all the lessons and data collection procedures of the summer camp. Results indicated that students’ CT skill increased during the summer camp and that the change in their CT skill was positively correlated to the time spent on S–R interaction. Additionally, how three kinds of S–R interaction—programming-computing, observational investigation, and participatory investigation—cultivated students’ CT were found. Moreover, the hierarchy of three S–R interactions and students’ role-shifting in the hierarchy were discussed. Previous studies rarely discussed S–R interaction; however, this kind of interaction should be explored because it provides more information about students’ natural learning process, which might be meaningful to RE practice.

The results showed that the technological problem-solving program positively affected participants’ CT-related competencies. Moreover, we observed improvement in participants’ attitudes toward technology due to the integration of CT into their technology education classes.

Two US high school science teachers and an engineering technology teacher sustained implementation of an integrated STEM curriculum after the conclusion of the funded program, TRAILS. Class observations were conducted to examine how the teachers implemented the integrated STEM curriculum and how they maintained integrated STEM teaching in a science and engineering technology education (ETE) teacher pair using science and engineering technology shared practices. After the integrated STEM lesson, their students’ academic achievements were compared to those of the students who previously participated in the project. The results reveal that the students showed no difference from the previous TRAILS students in terms of academic achievements as measured by STEM knowledge test scores, which may indicate that the teachers successfully maintained consistency and effectiveness of the implementation. Additionally, a twenty-first century skills survey was newly conducted to examine students’ growth in confidence in twenty-first century skills after they were taught the integrated STEM lesson. The students showed increased confidence in critical thinking, which indicates that the students benefitted from the teachers’ instructions even after the conclusion of the funded program and the absence of support.

This research used quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine the impacts of the design thinking–maker education intervention on primary school students to prove its effectiveness in improving the learners’ academic level and in developing their creative tendencies, and whether the design thinking–maker education intervention can help change the learners’ stereotypes of engineers. Herein, 136 Year 4 students took a course called Movement of Objects. Traditional instruction and a design thinking-maker education intervention were applied to the control and experimental groups (n = 68 each), respectively. All students underwent an academic pretest and posttest. Stereotypes of engineers were examined through the Draw-an-Engineer Test (DAET). Creative tendencies were investigated through a pretest and posttest questionnaire. Interviews were conducted to obtain course feedback and information on the participants’ perceptions of engineers. The significant between-group difference in preexisting knowledge disappeared on the posttest, and the experimental group exhibited a more significant improvement in their academic level (p < 0.01) than did the control group (p < 0.05). Regarding creative tendencies, significant pretest–posttest differences in adventure, curiosity, imagination, and the total score were observed in the experimental group. On the posttest of the DAET, the control group depicted significantly less facial hair but significantly more helmets and symbols of research and knowledge, whereas the experimental group depicted significantly less facial hair but significantly more helmets, symbols, and relevant captions.

The current study investigated how students’ reasoning differed based on selection. Researchers analyzed the comments in two ways: (1) computer-aided quantitative content analysis and (2) qualitative content analysis. In the first analysis, we performed sentiment analysis and word frequency analysis using natural language processing. Based on the findings, we explored how the design thinking process was embedded in student reasoning, and if the reasoning varied depending on the claim. Results from sentiment analysis showed that students tend to reveal more strong positive sentiment with short comments when providing reasoning for the selected design. In contrast, when providing reasoning for those items not chosen, results showed a weaker negative sentiment with more detailed reasons. Findings from word frequency analysis showed that students valued the function of design as well as the user perspective, specifically, convenience. Additionally, students took aesthetic features of each design into consideration when identifying the best of the two pairs.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this study is to derive a correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the computational thinking ability of gifted students in Korea. The correlation between each element was analyzed by looking at the sub-elements of computational thinking according to the components of technological thinking disposition. The experiment was conducted from September 2019 to February 2021 with 217 students of I Gifted School in Incheon, South Korea. The collected data were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient using the statistical program R using Google COLAB. A summary of the study results is as follows. First, regarding the correlation between technological thinking ability, among the 6 components of technological thinking disposition, technological creativity and expression disposition and technological manipulation disposition show the highest correlation at 0.851. This shows that students who have an excellent ability to implement algorithms with new ideas or express them in various other attempts when implementing programs for gifted students also tend to enjoy program coding or have a tendency to like coding. Second, concerning the correlation between the technological thinking disposition and the sub-factors of computational thinking, some elements showed negative correlations and some had almost no correlation index. Students with high technological curiosity, however, tended to show a 0.287 in the parallelism factor compared to other factors. This showed a generally high trend. It can be said that students who want to know the functions, uses, forms, and characteristics of functions while implementing programs tend to have a better ability to divide large tasks into smaller tasks and process them simultaneously compared with other sub-elements of computational thinking. Third, regarding the correlation between computational thinking skills, the correlation between data analysis and pattern recognition was the highest at 0.637. This indicates that students who have an excellent ability to analyze a given coding problem also can find rules in data, showing that students at gifted schools in Korea tend to enjoy problem-solving.

One example is the integrated Coding as Another Language pedagogy for coding, literacy, and social and emotional learning. The pedagogy was initially developed for students in kindergarten and early elementary school and has not previously been aligned to prekindergarten learning frameworks or used in the prekindergarten setting. In this paper, we describe a pilot program if the CAL pedagogy could be successfully used for the prekindergarten setting. The study used a design-based method to adapt the Coding as Another Language curriculum for the prekindergarten setting and a mixed-methods protocol to evaluate the program at a preschool site serving children experiencing homelessness in classrooms that are part of the local school district’s universal prekindergarten program. Students were assessed using the Coding Stages Assessment of coding knowledge and the TechCheck-PreK assessment of computational thinking. Teachers completed semi-structured interviews over the course of the project. Teachers reported overall positive experiences teaching the curriculum including for English language learners, although some reported challenges integrating the curricula in their bilingual classrooms. Children participating in the program significantly improved on their coding knowledge by 4.60 points on the Coding Stages Assessment, p < .0001. These findings suggest that the Coding as Another Language pedagogy can be successfully integrated with preschool learning frameworks and implemented in preschool classrooms.

It is based on 40 design cards, which aim to empower elementary students to empathize with the problem and ideate creatively and efficiently for identifying solutions. It was applied in 6 sessions with the participation of 31 elementary students preparing for an open educational robotics competition. Questionnaires and focus groups were used to gather data from the students who argued that the proposed approach allowed them to explore the problem in an unexpected, creative, and productive way. They managed to identify complex problems and produce innovative solutions utilizing a structured design process with ideation probes. Weaknesses of the framework, primarily focused on time management, were also identified and reported. We suggest that the proposed approach is a first step to creating design thinking methodologies for elementary students in educational robotics and STEAM.

JOUR ,,,,,"This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing design thinking competencies in the context of STE(A)M education, specifically within the Vietnamese educational system. The study, conducted over a period from September 2022 to February 2023, involved 935 high school students in Vietnam. The framework development utilized advanced statistical techniques, including first- and second-order Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), to ensure a robust psychometric assessment. The framework comprises five competency factors: empathy, problem setting, ideation, modelling, reasoning, and process management. The research findings demonstrated that the developed tool meets the criteria for internal consistency, reliability and validity, providing a valuable instrument for assessing students’ design thinking competencies in the Vietnamese STE(A)M education context. The study’s meticulous and rigorous psychometric evaluation represents a significant contribution to the understanding of design thinking competencies in the Vietnamese educational domain. Furthermore, the implications of the results extend beyond the Vietnamese context and have relevance for international education. The study enriches the understanding of measuring design thinking competencies in the context of STE(A)M education, providing valuable insights for educators and policymakers not only in Vietnam but also in other countries. The rigorous methodology and statistical analyses employed in the study contribute to the broader discourse on design thinking competencies in international educational settings.

JOUR ,,,,,"The nature of engineering design thinking needs to change drastically to address the climate crisis, as the technologies and activities that damage the environment are generated by engineering design. Current engineering design practices, as well as engineering design education (EE) pedagogies, are driven by formal knowledge structures, such as mathematical models and optimization techniques, that are far removed from concerns about the environment. To adapt engineering design thinking for sustainability, a clear characterization of the thinking roles played by various design components, including the role of formal structures in sustainable engineering design, is needed. As a first step towards developing this characterization, we investigated the way sustainable micro-hydro power systems were designed by two grassroots technology designers. Our analysis indicated that artifact-based imagination (mental simulation of material structure and dynamics), including artifact-based reasoning (manipulation of imagined artifacts), and synthesis (of requirements and constraints) were key to integrating the eco-social context into the design. Formal structures played a supportive role to these core design thinking processes. To examine the validity of this analysis, we studied two engineering design cases from other areas, exploring whether the patterns we identified using the micro-hydro turbine cases extended to these cases. Results suggested that artifact-based imagination and reasoning and synthesis are common threads across different kinds of engineering design. Based on this finding, we suggest that the ongoing redesign of EE—to support ecological sustainability—needs to focus on artifact-based imagination and synthesis of eco-social factors, in addition to formal structures.

In accordance with constructivist learning theory and the core elements of cultivating CT, this research has developed a Project-Based Teaching approach with computational thinking as its focal point. The focus of this study centered on the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing students’ CT abilities, particularly within the context of the “Computer Assembly and Maintenance” course, during a 16-week teaching experiment. Additionally, the study investigated the influence of gender on CT abilities. Using a pre-test/post-test design, the research has revealed significant differences in the development of CT under the two treatment conditions. The results indicated that project-based teaching significantly contributes to the development of students’ CT abilities. The experimental group outperformed the traditional teaching group significantly in the areas of collaboration, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Furthermore, project-based teaching had a positive impact on the CT of university students of different genders.

JOUR ,,,,,"Modern society needs to think of new approaches for solving problems with computing. Computational thinking is the process of abstracting and automating a variety of problems using computational technology. A system that expresses, manages, and processes knowledge such as computational thinking is called a knowledge-based system. This paper proposes to examine students’ knowledge about computational thinking when they want to develop a Python project, and the correlation/association between these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from a computer programming lecture. Through this data analysis, we try to identify the factors through the correlation between data and clustering technique in order to express and discover the knowledge about the learner’s computational thinking. For the verification of the factors identified, we analyzed the correlation between computational thinking and the pre- and post-test results of the LightBot. In addition to the regression analysis of the proven factors, the probability of the research model was analyzed through the structural equation to process the knowledge discovered. In this paper, we present various problems in the domain of programming education and analyze the means to diagnose and improve knowledge based on computational thinking by finding various problem-solving methods. To pre-examine the learner; he/she was diagnosed using a test paper and the LightBot execution test. We checked the learner’s current knowledge state by analyzing the correlation between the test site and the results of the LightBot. To analyze the level of knowledge improvement of learners, we designed an experiment to analyze the correlation between learning and the actual test results through a system that applied the problem-solving learning method. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that there was a correlation between the test results for a learner and the pre-test results of the LightBot. Additionally, the group mean scores of the learners who learned as per the proposed technique were observed to be significant. During this process, we analyzed the effects of problem-solving and system application on academic achievement through factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The ability to pinpoint various problem scenarios and solve problems more effectively using computational technologies will become more important in future. For this purpose, applying our proposed technique for deriving and improving knowledge based on computational thinking to software education will induce the interest of students and increase the learning effect.

JOUR ,,,,,"Scientific misconduct, leading to the retraction of publications, presents a significant challenge to the progress of societies as it undermines both the scientific reputation and material resources of countries. This study adopts bibliometric analysis and scientometrics approach to examine the characteristics of retracted publications in the engineering sciences, utilizing data extracted from the Web of Science database for the period spanning 1992 to 2021. The findings indicate that engineering science research exists on a global scale, accounting for 2,996 retracted documents and receiving 23,156 citations. The analysis also reveals that the highest rate of retractions was assigned to misconduct such as “Fraud, distortion, forgery, manipulation, salami slicing, fictitious or imaginary data” (n = 1,137), “Plagiarism” (n = 513), and “Duplicate publications” (n = 442). It was also found that the countries of Iran (7.50), People’s Republic of China (6.60) and Pakistan (4.80) have the highest number of retractions per 10,000 publications. Consequently, it is recommended that policymakers develop long-term strategies to safeguard research integrity by fostering a culture of systemic thinking within the research system and continuously educating researchers on the principles of publication ethics.

JOUR ,,,,,"While developments in GIS technology and methodologies continue to add great value to archaeological research, they have often fallen somewhat out of step with theoretical developments elsewhere in the discipline. The result is a technology that focuses on the practically possible—new questions emerge as and when the technology allows. While more experimental approaches exist in some sub-disciplines, such as studies of the North American Southwest or contemporary archaeology, these are not regularly incorporated elsewhere. This paper explores the possibilities for GIS-based research to engage with current theoretical debates surrounding posthumanism, and particularly assemblage thinking. A case study focuses on the European prehistoric heathlands, arguing that limiting our investigations to traditional realms of GIS practice means that much of the detail that defines different types of landscape disappears from view. By taking inspiration from assemblage thinking, I explore the multiple species that make up heathlands and define how they were experienced and interacted with in the Early Bronze Age of Denmark. Thus, I argue that GIS and posthumanism have much to offer one another in archaeological practice.

JOUR ,,,,,"The pervasive smart manufacturing is bringing increasing attention to digital twin. As a core part of virtual modeling, 3D virtual modeling is crucial to improve the intuitiveness of state monitoring, enhance human-cyber interactions, visualize conditions and simulations, and provide visual guides in digital twin. However, although 3D virtual modeling in digital twin has many benefits for different applications, its complex characteristics become obstacles for novice engineers to develop and utilize. Besides, research information about 3D virtual modeling in digital twin is too scattered, while there has been no literature review that specially and comprehensively summarizes and analyzes it. To help novice engineers understand and scheme 3D virtual modeling in digital twin for future research and applications, this paper reviews 106 digital twin 3D modeling cases with their characteristics, including deployment targets, purposes & roles, collaborative models, data flows, the autonomy of 3D modeling, fidelity, twinning rates, enabling technologies, and enabling tools. This paper then discusses and analyzes the review outcomes via statistics. Finally, this paper also proposes a thinking map for scheming the 3D virtual modeling in digital twin. In general, 3D virtual modeling is oriented by the motivation behind different digital twins, engineers hence should reflect on the purposes, scenarios, resources, and long-term visions of their projects. When designing characteristics of 3D virtual modeling, engineers must consider functions, capabilities of data processing and transmission, timeliness of data, applicability, and specialty of each characteristic. For future work, this paper highlights three important research issues to realize the prospect of 3D virtual modeling, including the versatility of autonomous 3D modeling, incremental updates of 3D models, and optimal planning of data collections for 3D modeling. Besides, future work will also investigate the enhancement of 3D virtual modeling via relevant information technologies, such as IoT-based data collections, machine vision-based data processing, and adaptive machine learning-based dynamic modeling.

JOUR ,,,,,"Industrial internet platforms are regarded as an emerging fashion for the flexible integration of production resources located in multiple sites to complete complicated tasks submitted by users. Manufacturing Service Composition (MSC) is an essential technique that supports the optimal construction of value-added services. Evolutionary computation approaches are frequently employed to resolve MSC issues and have achieved great accomplishments. These evolutionary solvers, however, require massive computational resources for objective evaluation and face cold-start problem. Recent advances in transfer learning field provide a new means for extracting knowledge across tasks to enhance the problem-solving efficiency. In light of above, this article is intended to devise a Multi-task Transfer Evolutionary Search (MTES) approach for MSC considering the occurrence of multiple user requests, with which each corresponds to a MSC task, optimization experiences from constructing distinct MSC tasks can be learned to promote the search of arrival tasks at hand jointly. The MTES can adapt the helper task selection and the intensity of knowledge transfer from a synergistic perspective, such that it can be suitable for many-task scenario. Numerical studies on different scales of MSC tasks demonstrate that, compared to the prevalent peers, our proposed MTES needs far less computational resources to achieve the convergence performance and the solution quality is higher, which verifies the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach for dealing with MSC problem.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to determine how the pre-service teachers anticipated students’ diverse mathematical thinking before and after experience in the course along with their propensity to adapt problems to respond to diversity during instruction. Furthermore, the pre-test to post-test changes in pre-service teachers’ anticipations of students’ problem-solving strategies and adaptations of problems were statistically significant.

Teachers engaged in professional development sessions about CT. Using their mathematics curriculum materials as a starting point, teachers then planned mathematics lessons to incorporate attention to at least one CT practice. Researchers transcribed their conversations and qualitatively coded the transcripts using an established framework for assessing the cognitive demand of tasks posed to students. Analyses of the planning conversations suggested that encouraging these teachers to examine their mathematics curriculum materials through the lens of CT practices supported them in adapting tasks from their curriculum materials in ways that raised the cognitive demand.

The study to be presented in this paper pursued the question as to which subdomains or tasks relating to procedural fluency and strategic competence at upper primary school level are particularly challenging for elementary school student teachers. The newly devised assessment instrument included mathematical problems from a wide variety of content domains such as numbers and operations with natural and rational numbers, place value, computational strategies, estimation, (inverse) proportion, combinatorics, mathematization, and word problems. A preceding theoretical task analysis ensured that the solution of the problems required adaptation of strategies and flexible reasoning about a procedure or a formula. In the assessment, each of the 15 tasks were presented to 280 first-semester student teachers. As the results of the analyses indicate, combinatorial problems and division problems with rational numbers proved to be particularly challenging for a large proportion of the participants. Supplemental qualitative analyses of solution pathways confirmed that the assessment tasks allowed for multiple solution pathways. The item difficulties could be explained by a lack of ability to link mental models, strategies, and procedures.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study investigated the development of prospective elementary teachers (PETs)’ subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge for teaching early algebra through participation in case discussions. PETs attended five weeks of intervention as part of a method course, which included case discussions. During the intervention, the participants were presented with big ideas of equivalence and equations, generalized arithmetic, and functional thinking as the content of early algebra through text-based classroom cases. Data were collected through one-hour individual interviews before and after the early algebra lessons. The analysis of the pre-interviews indicated that prospective elementary teachers may not be ready to foster algebraic thinking in elementary grades in terms of the required knowledge for teaching. We found that PETs needed more development of required subject matter knowledge to guide algebraic thinking in elementary grades, such as the relational meaning of the equal sign, generalizing, representing, or justifying arithmetic or functional relationships, and reasoning with them. Likewise, PETs were found to lack in pedagogical content knowledge related to students’ conceptions and misconceptions and effective teaching strategies to promote early algebraic thinking. However, we found that specifically designed method courses could help develop PETs’ knowledge of teaching early algebra. Following early algebra lessons centered around case discussions, PETs showed progress in multiple aspects of knowledge across all big ideas, though their improvement in generalized arithmetic was somewhat less pronounced. This progress was observed in their subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge.

In this article, Bernstein’s description of the general recontextualizing processes is used to identify the local processes which contributed to teacher educators’ meaning-making, when a new school curriculum reform was introduced in Norway. The reform was about integrating computational thinking, including programming, into mathematics teaching. Audio recordings and documentation from groups of teacher educators’ first discussions about the reform in a professional seminar were analyzed, using Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis. In developing their meaning-making, the teacher educators adapted their previous knowledge through two local recontextualizing processes, which were labeled simplifying and solidifying. Through joint negotiation, simplifying reduced the complexity of computational thinking, while solidifying simultaneously built up certainty about how to integrate the reform into the teacher educators’ existing practices. The formation and implementation of these local processes were affected by the short time between the introduction of the curriculum and its inclusion into mathematics teacher education courses, as well as the specific contextual features of the seminar.

While previous research investigated energy input or food decisions, little is known about energy output or leisure activity decisions. By combining experimental decision-making paradigms and computational approaches, we investigated the psychological mechanisms of self-controlled food and leisure activity decisions through the effects of reward-oriented and health-oriented preferences as well as body weight status, stress, and coping. Based on individual’s responses, the self-controlled food and leisure activity choices were indexed as the proportions of “no” unhealthy but tasty (or enjoyable) (inhibitory self-control against short-term pleasure) and “yes” healthy but not tasty (or not enjoyable) responses (initiatory self-control for long-term health benefits). The successful self-control decisions for food and leisure activity were positively correlated with each other, r = 22, p < .01. In beta regression analyses, the successful self-controlled food decisions decreased as the taste-oriented process increased, β = − 0.50, z = -2.99, p < .005, and increased as the health-oriented process increased, β = 1.57, z = 4.68, p < .001. Similarly, the successful self-controlled leisure activity decisions decreased as the enjoyment-oriented process increased, β = − 0.79, z = -5.31, p < .001, and increased as the health-oriented process increased, β = 0.66, z = 2.19, p < .05. The effects of the other factors were not significant. Overall, our findings demonstrated the mutual interrelationship between food and leisure activity decision-making and suggest that encouraging health-oriented processes may benefit both energy input and expenditure domains and improve self-controlled choices.

JOUR ,,,,,"Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as a powerful ensemble of approaches aiming at developing integrated mathematical and computational models elucidating the complex interactions between pharmacology, physiology, and disease. As the field grows and matures its applications expand beyond the boundaries of research and development and slowly enter the decision making and regulatory arenas. However, widespread acceptance and eventual adoption of a new modeling approach requires assessment criteria and quantifiable metrics that establish credibility and increase confidence in model predictions. QSP aims to provide an integrated understanding of pathology in the context of therapeutic interventions. Because of its ambitious nature and the fact that QSP emerged in an uncoordinated manner as a result of activities distributed across organizations and academic institutions, high entropy characterizes the tools, methods, and computational methodologies and approaches used. The eventual acceptance of QSP model predictions as supporting material for an application to a regulatory agency will require that two key aspects are considered: (1) increase confidence in the QSP framework, which drives standardization and assessment; and (2) careful articulation of the expectations. Both rely heavily on our ability to rigorously and consistently assess QSP models. In this manuscript, we wish to discuss the meaning and purpose of such an assessment in the context of QSP model development and elaborate on the differentiating features of QSP that render such an endeavor challenging. We argue that QSP establishes a conceptual, integrative framework rather than a specific and well-defined computational methodology. QSP elicits the use of a wide variety of modeling and computational methodologies optimized with respect to specific applications and available data modalities, which exceed the data structures employed by chemometrics and PK/PD models.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is believed to be a critical factor to facilitate STEM learning, and a vital learning objective itself. Therefore, researchers are continuing to explore effective ways to improve and assess it. Makerspaces feature various hands-on activities, which can attract students with diverse interests from different backgrounds. If well designed, scaffolded maker activities have the potential to improve students’ CT skills and STEM learning. In this study, we explore ways to improve and assess physics and engineering integrated CT skills through developing maker activities and assessments, which are applicable in both informal and formal educational settings. Our paper presents our work on improving and assessing CT in maker activities with two primary goals. First, it introduces the maker activities and instruments we developed to improve and assess CT that are integrated in physics and engineering learning. Second, it presents the students’ CT skill and disposition change from pretest to posttest in two summer academies with CT enhanced maker activities, which was respectively led by after school educators and formal educators in a public library.

To properly cultivate CT skills and the related dispositions, educators must understand students’ needs and build awareness of how CT informs a deeper understanding of the academic content area. “Assessing Computational Thinking in Maker Activities” (ACTMA) is a design-based research study that developed a curricular unit around physics, making, and CT. The project in this paper studied how instructors could use formative assessment to uncover students’ prior knowledge and improve their use of CT. This study aims to provide a qualitative analysis of one lesson in the unit implementation of an informal makerspace environment that strived to be culturally responsive. The study examined “moments of notice,” or instances where formative assessment could guide students’ understanding of CT. We found elements in the establishment of a classroom culture that can generate a continual use of informal formative assessment between instructors and students. This culture includes using materials in conjunction with the promotion of CT concepts and dispositions, focusing on drawing for understanding, the practice of debugging, and fluidity of roles in the learning space.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper describes the work done by sixth grade students to achieve and sustain productive and personally meaningful lines of inquiry with computational models. The capacity to frame interactions with tools as dialogic exchanges with co-participants is a productive practice for disciplinary engagement in science and for computational thinking (Chandrasekharan and Nersessian 2015; Dennet 1989; Latour 1993; Pickering 1995). We propose that computational models have unique affordances for dialogic interaction because they are probabilistic and iteratively executable, features that provide an entry point for students to adopt stances that treat computational models as participants. Our analysis reveals that existing patterns in students’ social interactions are resources for interacting flexibly with computational tools as participants. In particular, we found that students treated computational models as participants in three ways: (1) as conversational peers, (2) as co-constructors of lines of inquiry, and (3) as projections of students’ agency and identity. Our data also demonstrate that students take on flexible, rather than fixed, stances toward computational participants. These stances parallel scientists’ interactions with non-human entities, which often involve treating tools as agentive participants in inquiry (Latour 1999; Pickering 1995), affording students a pathway to practices at the intersection of disciplinary engagement and computational thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) and modeling are authentic practices that scientists and engineers use frequently in their daily work. Advances in computing technologies have further emphasized the centrality of modeling in science by making computationally enabled model use and construction more accessible to scientists. As such, it is important for all students to get exposed to these practices in K-12 science classrooms. This study investigated how a week-long intervention in a regular middle school science classroom that introduced CT and simulation-based model building through block-based programming influenced students’ learning of CT and force and motion concepts. Eighty-two seventh-grade students from a public middle school participated in the study. Quantitative data sources included pre- and post-assessments of students’ understanding of force and motion concepts and CT abilities. Qualitative data sources included classroom observation notes, student interviews, and students’ reflection statements. During the intervention, students were introduced to CT using block-based programming and engaged in constructing simulation-based computational models of physical phenomena. The findings of the study indicated that engaging in building computational models resulted in significant conceptual learning gains for the sample of this study. The affordances of the dynamic nature of computational models let students both observe and interact with the target phenomenon in real time while the generative dimension of model construction promoted a rich classroom discourse facilitating conceptual learning. This study contributes to the nascent literature on integrating CT into K-12 science curricula by emphasizing the affordances and generative dimension of model construction through block-based programming.

We discuss students’ understanding of the relationship between a simple model of an ecosystem and the actual phenomenon it represents, their engagement with the unit’s data-gathering and data analysis activities, their ability to engage in sense-making regarding data they generated and analyzed, and how collectively the study supports their understanding of the complex system.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking requires high cognitive load as students work to manage multiple tasks in their problem-solving environment. Through research in K-2 classrooms on computational thinking, we noticed that students lack the representational fluency needed to move from one form to another—such as moving from physical to more abstract representations. Therefore, the following research question was studied: How do second-grade students use and translate among representations to solve computational thinking tasks using the robot mouse game? To address this, we employed a task-based interview approach with three second-grade students who were engaged in four computational thinking tasks using the Code and Go Robot Mouse Coding Activity Set developed by Learning Resources. Through four clinical tasks involving the robot mouse, students solved puzzles set up to force them to make particular representational translations. Each translation involved a level of cognitive complexity the students needed to manage to successfully complete the task. We found that students translated between many different representations using concrete representations to ease translations, language as a scaffold between translations, and embodied movements as representations or to assist with translation. Furthermore, the levels of representational maturity showed by the students varied with the difficulty of the task, and the spatial orientation was particularly difficult for them. These results provide important insights into how learners may develop their ability to engage with abstract representations that will be part of future practices associated with activities in science, mathematics, engineering, and computational thinking.

We validated the instrument in a cohort of 5–9-year-old students (N = 768) participating in a research study involving a robotics coding curriculum. TechCheck showed good reliability and validity according to measures of classical test theory and item response theory. Discrimination between skill levels was adequate. Difficulty was suitable for first graders and low for second graders. The instrument showed differences in performance related to race/ethnicity. TechCheck scores correlated moderately with a previously validated CT assessment tool (TACTIC-KIBO).

As expected, prior experience in physics teaching was related to teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching physics in 9th grade. Also, teachers’ prior experience with programming was strongly related to their self-efficacy regarding the programming component of model construction. Surprisingly, the short interaction with computational modeling increased the group’s self-efficacy, and the average rating of understanding and enjoyment was similar among teachers with and without prior programming experience.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational models are increasingly being used in K-12 science classrooms to engage students in developing and testing explanations of phenomena. However, research has only begun to consider whether integrating computational models into science instruction could be particularly beneficial to students from diverse backgrounds, including a fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) in the U.S. context. As this research begins to take shape, we argue for moving beyond the traditional discourse focused on “accommodating” ELs, which de-emphasizes the assets these students bring, and shifting our attention to the distinct affordances that computational models offer for harnessing ELs’ rich meaning-making potential. In this article, we conceptualize the affordances of computational models for ELs in science instruction. Specifically, we highlight evolving theories in the field of language education that undergird the shift from accommodations to affordances with ELs in the science classroom. We then propose affordances of computational models for ELs in relation to three framework components: modalities, registers, and interactions. Finally, we report on an initial inquiry into these affordances using student interview data from a linguistically diverse elementary science classroom. Ultimately, we argue that an affordances perspective could inform research and the design of learning environments that contribute to broadening participation in science learning and refuting deficit-based views of students traditionally underserved in STEM subjects.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study explored teachers’ conceptualizations of integrated computational modeling in secondary physics by exposing twelve experienced physics teachers to programming and then analyzing interview responses. Responses revealed that teachers fell along a spectrum of disciplinary boundary–stretching mentalities. This paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for exploring both horizontal (interdisciplinary) and vertical (intradisciplinary) boundary stretching, as well as for identifying bounded mentalities as teachers consider integration. Horizontal boundary stretchers envisioned opportunities to use computational modeling to shift their curriculum or pedagogical approaches in physics to help students enhance skills underlying multiple fields, while vertical boundary stretchers considered how computing might allow students to explore physics concepts more deeply. Teachers with more boundary-stretching indicators at the outset of an integrated curriculum development workshop were more likely to persist in the implementation of computational modeling–integrated materials in their physics classrooms than those who expressed more bounded thinking. These findings emphasize the importance of considering teachers’ perceptions about how their own science discipline is connected to similar fields and provide implications about how to identify potential adopters of innovative teaching approaches.

Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions.

JOUR ,,,,,"As a result of COVID-19, various forms of education and teaching are moving online. However, the notion of an online STEM camp is still in its beginnings, and there is little relevant research and experience in this context. At the beginning of April 2021, the research team launched an online STEM charity camp with the theme of “Shen Nong Tastes Herbs.” Participants included 113 third- and fourth-grade primary school students ranging from 8 to 12 years of age from four schools in Karamay, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with weak educational capabilities. The camp lasted for 3 days and included 7 activities, while remote teaching was accomplished through Dingtalk. Pre- and post-test questionnaires and interviews were used to explore the impact of this camp on students. We found that online STEM camps could improve students’ self-efficacy, computational thinking, and task value, and there is a significant improvement in the self-efficacy (p = 0.000) and task value (p = 0.001) dimensions. In addition, students with high self-efficacy had higher scores in the other two dimensions. Finally, we summarized the experiences and gains of students and teachers and proposed suggestions for developing online camps based on this experience.What Is Already Known About this Topic• STEM and robotics education have a positive impact on student development.• Students’ self-efficacy, computational thinking, and task value are very important and popular research areas in STEM education.• STEM education camps can promote students’ teamwork skills and other abilities. However, due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little research concerning online STEM education.What this Paper Contributes• An online STEM education charity camp was launched for schools with weak educational capabilities.• Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the online camp effectively integrated traditional Chinese herbal medicine culture, LEGO robots, and STEM knowledge.• This paper explored the relationship among students’' self-efficacy, computational thinking and task value.Implications for Practice and/or Policy• This paper developed an online STEM course with multidisciplinary integration to provide ideas for instructional designers.• This paper summarized the experience of online STEM education camps and provided suggestions for the implementation of online camps in the future.• This paper encouraged more educators to pay attention to students living in areas with weak educational capabilities and to actually promote the balanced development of education.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper shares findings from a teacher designed physics and computing unit that engaged students in learning physics and computing concurrently thru inquiry. Using scientific inquiry skills and practices, students were tasked with assessing the validity of local rollercoaster g-force ratings as posted to the public. Students used computational electronic textile circuits (e-textiles) to engage in “myth busting” amusement park g-force ratings. In doing so, students engaged computing and computational thinking skills in service to answering their scientific inquiry. Findings from this study indicate that physics classes are ideal spaces for engaging in computing’s Big Ideas as laid out by Grover and Pea (Educational Researcher 42, 38–43, 2013) as well as the pillars of computational thinking (Wing, Communications of the ACM 49, 33–35, 2006). However, essential to this dual engagement is a need for computing content to act in service to the better acquisition of physics content within the physics classroom space. Findings indicate that the teachers’ use of e-textiles to integrate physics and computing broadened and deepened student learning by providing affordances for computational thinking within the structure of physical science inquiry.

JOUR ,,,,,"Programming and automation continue to evolve rapidly and advance the capabilities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, physical computing (the integration of programming and interactive physical devices) integrated within biomedical contexts remains an area of limited focus in secondary STEM education programs. As this is an emerging area, many educators may not be well prepared to teach physical computing concepts within authentic biomedical contexts. This shortcoming provided the rationale for this study, to examine if professional development (PD) had a noticeable influence on high school science and technology and engineering (T&E) teachers’ (1) perceptions of teaching biomedical and computational thinking (CT) concepts and (2) plans to integrate physical computing within the context of authentic biomedical engineering challenges. The findings revealed a significant difference in the amount of biomedical and CT concepts that teachers planned to implement as a result of the PD. Using a modified version of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-A) Riggs and Enochs in Science Education, 74(6), 625–637 (1990), analyses revealed significant gains in teachers’ self-efficacy toward teaching both biomedical and CT concepts from the PD. Further analyses revealed that teachers reported increases in their perceived knowledge of biomedical and CT concepts and a significant increase in their intent to collaborate with a science or T&E educator outside of their content area. This study provides implications for researchers and educators to integrate more biomedical and physical computing instruction at the secondary education level.

JOUR ,,,,,"Understanding the world around us is a growing necessity for the whole public, as citizens are required to make informed decisions in their everyday lives about complex issues. Systems thinking (ST) is a promising approach for developing solutions to various problems that society faces and has been acknowledged as a crosscutting concept that should be integrated across educational science disciplines. However, studies show that engaging students in ST is challenging, especially concerning aspects like change over time and feedback. Using computational system models and a system dynamics approach can support students in overcoming these challenges when making sense of complex phenomena. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that examines how 10th grade students engage in aspects of ST through computational system modeling as part of a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. We show students’ increased capacity to explain the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon in terms of change over time that goes beyond linear causal relationships. However, student models and their accompanying explanations were limited in scope as students did not address feedback mechanisms as part of their modeling and explanations. In addition, we describe specific challenges students encountered when evaluating and revising models. In particular, we show epistemological barriers to fruitful use of real-world data for model revision. Our findings provide insights into the opportunities of a system dynamics approach and the challenges that remain in supporting students to make sense of complex phenomena and nonlinear mechanisms.

JOUR ,,,,,"Interpreting and creating computational systems models is an important goal of science education. One aspect of computational systems modeling that is supported by modeling, systems thinking, and computational thinking literature is “testing, evaluating, and debugging models.” Through testing and debugging, students can identify aspects of their models that either do not match external data or conflict with their conceptual understandings of a phenomenon. This disconnect encourages students to make model revisions, which in turn deepens their conceptual understanding of a phenomenon. Given that many students find testing and debugging challenging, we set out to investigate the various testing and debugging behaviors and behavioral patterns that students use when building and revising computational system models in a supportive learning environment. We designed and implemented a 6-week unit where students constructed and revised a computational systems model of evaporative cooling using SageModeler software. Our results suggest that despite being in a common classroom, the three groups of students in this study all utilized different testing and debugging behavioral patterns. Group 1 focused on using external peer feedback to identify flaws in their model, group 2 used verbal and written discourse to critique their model’s structure and suggest structural changes, and group 3 relied on systemic analysis of model output to drive model revisions. These results suggest that multiple aspects of the learning environment are necessary to enable students to take these different approaches to testing and debugging.

This use of computational models, which often involves algorithms and uncertainty that are hidden to the public, has implications for environmental science literacy. This study applies a design-based research approach to explore how technology-infused science instruction can scaffold secondary students in developing proficiency with computational modeling of groundwater contamination as a facet of environmental science literacy. Descriptions of research-based, technology-infused learning experiences situated within a groundwater contamination issue–based context are shared, and evidence of students’ subsequent learning is presented. Findings suggest that student learning may be supported by enacting instructional experiences that scaffold students in (a) developing first concrete then increasingly abstract understanding of groundwater system structure, function, and dynamics; (b) building conceptual connections between multiple types of models and representations of a system; and (c) explicitly engaging with and judging uncertainties associated with system models, model outputs, and associated arguments.

Validity and reliability of the Turkish version were established through classical test theory and item response theory, as had been done for the original English language version. Based on classical test theory, the confirmatory factor analysis used A tetrachoric weighted matrix to test the instrument’s structure. The one-dimensional structure of the instrument was verified. The KR-20 reliability coefficient for the scale consisting of one dimension and 15 items was .87, which is considered an acceptable level of reliability. Rasch and 2PL models were compared with M2 statistics to determine the item and test parameters based on item response theory (IRT). The 2PL model was chosen as the best fit. Mean TechCheck scores differed based on gender, socio-economic status, past exposure to computers, and coding experience.

Data was collected from 306 eighth grade (ages 13–14) students in rural indigenous communities in the Artic and urban and suburban Northeast communities in the USA. The project met its goal of producing an intentional instructional sequence that integrates disciplinary science and CT practices to increase students’ science knowledge and their ability to use CT skills and processes. The results indicate that teachers were able to use the curriculum to embed CT practices into the classroom. Students, in turn, had the opportunity to practice using these skills in class discussion as evidenced by the classroom observation data, and students’ science knowledge of CT content and practices significantly increased as evidenced by their performance on the weather content and CT skills pre- and post-assessments.

Computational thinking is an analytical process that requires defining problems and at the same time solving these problems by proceeding in creative ways. Based on this possible pattern of relationship between computational thinking and creativity, the aim of this study was to determine how two different versions of the computational thinking approach (plugged and unplugged) affect 6th-grade students' creative problem-solving skills (CPSS). Thus, two different teaching modules were designed on the circulatory system with a focus on plugged and unplugged computational thinking. A quasi-experimental design was used. Experiment group 1 utilized the plugged teaching module, experiment group 2 worked with the unplugged teaching module, and the control group in the Turkish middle school science curriculum's inquiry-based science activities. All three groups participated in 16 h of lessons over a 4-week period. We utilized the Creative Problem Solving Skills Inventory (CPSSI) for data collection. The results demonstrated that both the plugged and unplugged teaching modules were more successful at enhancing the CPSS than the inquiry-based science activities. Furthermore the unplugged teaching module was significantly more successful in developing CPSS compared to inquiry-based science activities. Hence, this empirical study demonstrated that both plugged and unplugged computational thinking approaches can enhance CPSS, but also reveals the greater effectiveness of unplugged approaches in fostering middle school students' CPSS.

Unfortunately, standardized, valid, and reliable methods to assess CT skills in preschool children are lacking, compromising the reliability of the results reported in CT interventions. To surpass this limitation, we validated in a sample of 700 preschool students (5–6 years old) the Beginners Computational Thinking test Short-Form (BCTt-SF), an unplugged 12-item instrument that measures three of the most common computational concepts assessed in preschool research: sequences, loops, and conditionals. The theoretical model underpinning the BCTt-SF was supported by dimensionality assessment, which suggested that preschool students can be distinguished in terms of four specific abilities (i.e., sequences, simple loops, nested loops, and conditionals) and that all of these abilities were related by a general factor. We modeled this hierarchical structure with a bi-factor model that presented excellent psychometric properties, from good statistical fit indices to adequate reliability of the general ability. To take full advantage of this model, we created an online application in the Shiny platform (https://computationalthinkingtests.shinyapps.io/SF-BCTt/) for the seamless scoring of examinees by any teacher or researcher who uses the BCTt-SF to assess CT skills in preschool children.

Additionally, 53 effect sizes involving 2192 participants emerging from the search were subjected to a meta-analysis investigating the effects of educational robotics on kindergarteners’ communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. The results showed that robots may enhance collaboration the most among young learners (effect size: 0.875) and may contribute to their communicative skills (effect size: 0.481). Additionally, their cognitive development might be improved by facilitating their critical thinking (effect size: 0.561), and creativity may be affected positively too (effect size: 0.511).

Students learned about natural selection through scaffolded transfer via Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE), an unplugged instructional approach. The data source is students’ explanations of four pre- and post-unit natural selection scenarios about bacteria, mice, lilies, and mosquitos. This mixed methods study included nonparametric statistics to determine differences between contexts in post-unit explanations and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to create and compare networks of co-occurrences in students’ explanations. There were significant differences between the four pre-unit scenario explanations, but the post-unit explanations displayed fewer differences. ENA analysis indicated that student responses for each scenario were not significantly different. These trends indicate students’ explanations of natural selection based on context varied less after the unit. These results suggest that the unit was successful in scaffolding transfer of natural selection context across contexts.

Therefore, educators and researchers are trying to integrate CT into teaching practices. Efforts to teach CT are increasing, especially in basic courses widely included in school curricula. The focus of this study is the integration of CT into science teaching in the flipped classroom model. In this context, the effects of flipped computational science laboratory (Flipped-CSL) activities carried out with teacher candidates on CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitude were investigated. An intertwined mixed research design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were evaluated together, was used in the study. Findings showed that flipped-CSL activities were effective for teacher candidates and improved their CT skills, laboratory entrepreneurship, and attitudes significantly and positively. The results of this study include the practical use of flipped-CSL activities when planning laboratory activities for school science subjects to improve CT skills. Implications for using of flipped-CSL activities in science education were discussed, and suggestions were made regarding the results.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking is an important skill applicable to multiple disciplines and can be difficult to teach due to the stress and frustration novice learners feel from cognitively challenging learning activities. While existing theories like Zone of Proximal Development, Flow Theory, and Zone of Proximal Flow suggest that an ideal mode of learning could be achieved when the complexity of learning tasks is reduced enough to match the skillfulness of beginning learners, further evidence is needed. This study focused on non-STEM major students building desktop smart greenhouses using micro:bit. Adopting a convergent mixed methods design, we collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data that captured individuals’ attitudinal shifts. Data analysis showed that while the beginner friendliness of micro:bit strengthened participants’ competence beliefs, their anxiety unexpectedly held or increased. These findings highlight the need for refining existing theoretical models to account for (1) the existence of additional dimensions, such as career readiness, that could fundamentally reshape the stratification of the learning zones, and (2) the existence of a dynamic zone of anxiety that expands with individuals’ increasing skillfulness.

JOUR ,,,,,"In computational complexity theory, decision problems are divided into complexity classes based on the amount of computational resources it takes for algorithms to solve them. In theoretical computer science, it is commonly accepted that only functions for solving problems in the complexity class P, solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, are considered to be tractable. In cognitive science and philosophy, this tractability result has been used to argue that only functions in P can feasibly work as computational models of human cognitive capacities. One interesting area of computational complexity theory is descriptive complexity, which connects the expressive strength of systems of logic with the computational complexity classes. In descriptive complexity theory, it is established that only first-order (classical) systems are connected to P, or one of its subclasses. Consequently, second-order systems of logic are considered to be computationally intractable, and may therefore seem to be unfit to model human cognitive capacities. This would be problematic when we think of the role of logic as the foundations of mathematics. In order to express many important mathematical concepts and systematically prove theorems involving them, we need to have a system of logic stronger than classical first-order logic. But if such a system is considered to be intractable, it means that the logical foundation of mathematics can be prohibitively complex for human cognition. In this paper I will argue, however, that this problem is the result of an unjustified direct use of computational complexity classes in cognitive modelling. Placing my account in the recent literature on the topic, I argue that the problem can be solved by considering computational complexity for humanly relevant problem solving algorithms and input sizes.

JOUR ,,,,,"To explain why, in scientific problem solving, a diagram can be “worth ten thousand words,” Jill Larkin and Herbert Simon (1987) relied on a computer model: two representations can be “informationally” equivalent but differ “computationally,” just as the same data can be encoded in a computer in multiple ways, more or less suited to different kinds of processing. The roots of this proposal lay in cognitive psychology, more precisely in the “imagery debate” of the 1970s on whether there are image-like mental representations. Simon (1972, 1978) hoped to solve this debate by thoroughly reducing the differences between forms of mental representations (e.g., between images and sentences) to differences in computational efficiency; to carry out this reduction, he borrowed from computer science the concepts of data type and of data structure. I argue that, in the end, his account amounted to nothing more than characterizing representations by the fast operations on them. This analysis then allows me to assess what Simon’s approach actually achieves when transported from psychology to the study of scientific representations, as in Larkin and Simon (1987): it allows comparing, not representations in and of themselves, but rather the computational roles they play in particular problem-solving processes—that is, representations together with a particular way of using them.

JOUR ,,,,,"According to the multiple realization argument, mental states or processes can be realized in diverse and heterogeneous physical systems; and that fact implies that mental state or process kinds cannot be identified with particular kinds of physical states or processes. More specifically, mental processes cannot be identified with brain processes. Moreover, the argument provides a general model for the autonomy of the special sciences. The multiple realization argument is widely influential, but over the last thirty years it has also faced serious objections. Despite those objections, most philosophers regard the fact of multiple realization and the cogency of the multiple realization argument as plainly correct. Why is that? What is it about the multiple realization argument that makes it so resilient? One reason is that the multiple realization argument is deeply intertwined with a view that minds are, in some sense, computational. But we argue that the sense in which minds are computational does not support the conclusion that they are ipso facto multiply realized. We argue that the sense in which brains compute does not imply that brains implement multiply realizable computational processes, and it does not provide a general model for the autonomy of the special sciences.

JOUR ,,,,,"E-science, or networked, collaborative and multidisciplinary scientific research on a shared e-infrastructure using computational tools, methods and applications, has also brought about new networked organizational forms in the transition of higher education towards the entrepreneurial academy. While the under-representation of women in ICTs is well-recorded, it is also known that the potential of new organizational forms such as networked structures to promote gender equality remains ambiguous, as they tend to perpetuate already existing inequalities due to their embeddedness in larger and longer-term structural or institutional gender effects. Based on a year-long ethnographic study in a networked academic e-science collaboration in Sweden and 45 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with its affiliated researchers, this article analyzes the multi-level obstacles to achieving gender equality in e-science to highlight the ways in which gendered disparities persist in this new, project-based academic networked organization in Sweden, hereafter called eSec. At the organizational level eSec remains deeply embedded in the traditional disciplinary and institutional academic setting, inadvertently reproducing existing gender imbalances across sciences. Furthermore, as a project-based organization, it is also embedded in the shift towards an entrepreneurial university model driven by new managerialism, the latter having a well-documented adverse effect in gender equality. This represents a structural-level obstacle which leads to especially female junior faculty leaving academy for industry. An individual level obstacle is observed alongside these as disavowal (Verleugnung) of gender disparities, an affect identified as a key mechanism of subjectivation in neoliberalism.

JOUR ,,,,,"With the widespread deployment of dense Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, satellites can serve as an alternative solution to the lack of proximal multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers for mobile Internet of Things (IoT) devices in remote areas. Simultaneously, leveraging federated learning (FL) to address data privacy concerns in the context of satellite-terrestrial cooperative IoT is a prudent choice. However, in the traditional satellite-ground FL framework where model aggregation occurs solely on satellite onboard terminals, challenges of insufficient satellite computational resources and congested core networks are encountered. Hence, we propose a cost-efficient satellite-terrestrial assisted hierarchical federated edge learning (STA-HFEL) architecture in which the satellite edge server performs as intermediaries for partial FL aggregation between IoT devices and the remote cloud. We further introduced an innovative communication scheme between satellites based on Intra-plane ISLs in this paper. Accordingly, considering the resource constraints of battery-limited devices, we define a joint computation and communication resource optimization problem for device users to achieve global cost minimization. By decomposing it into local training computational resource allocation subproblem and local model uploading communication resource subproblem, we used a distributed Jacobi-Proximal ADMM (JPADMM) algorithm to tackle the formulated problem iteratively. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the potential of STA-HFEL as a cost-efficient and privacy-preserving approach for machine learning tasks across distributed remote environments.

JOUR ,,,,,"Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) is used for pattern recognition and classification, diagnosis, and prediction of a multivariate data set. Mahalanobis Distance (MD), orthogonal array (OA), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used in traditional MTS in order to identify and optimize the variables. However, the high correlation among variables shows an effect on the inverse of the correlation matrix that uses in the calculation of MD and hence affects the accuracy of the MD. Therefore, Mahalanobis-Taguchi-Gram-Schmidt (MTGS) system is proposed in order to solve the problem of multicollinearity. The value of MD can be calculated by using the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Process (GSOP). Besides, the computational speed and the accuracy in optimization using OA and SNR are other issues that are concerned the authors. Hence, the combination of MTS and other methods such as Binary Particles Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and Binary Ant Colony Optimization (NBACO) is proposed to improve the computational speed and the accuracy in optimization. The purpose of this paper is to review and summarize some works that developed and used the hybrid methodology of MTS as well as its application in several fields.

JOUR ,,,,,"Various studies have suggested that computational thinking needs to be highlighted as one of the essential abilities and it should be taught in the standard K-10 curriculum. However, the standard K-10 curriculum does not always contain accessible technology that uses interactive teaching methods and efficient analytical skill development. Also, most practical computational thinking applications that are being created seem to be complex and expensive for educational settings. In this work, we introduce PlutoAR, a marker-based augmented reality (AR) interpreter that is scalable, inexpensive, portable, and can be used as a platform for kids to enhance their skills in an inclusive way. PlutoAR incorporates AR through an interactive toolkit to give students the experiences of both the real and virtual worlds, overcoming the limitations of traditional and non-interactive setups. With the help of technology-based solutions, this effort intends to enable students from all demographic groups to engage in the learning process, regardless of their level of competence. The PlutoAR mobile application presently runs on any Android device with a camera. It creates inbuilt AR experiences like stories, basic elementary mathematics, navigating mazes utilising conditional loops to solve them, and the intuition of gravity. The usability of the PutoAR application is verified by performing the qualitative and quantitative analysis through user feedback. The application seems to be acceptable by users with a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of more than 80. In future, we intend to provide flexibility to the user for adding new content inside the application whenever needed and to promote AR-based collaboration among the students.

JOUR ,,,,,"There is an ever-increasing number of public users of the internet just to remain learned and updated as well as distribute millions of posts, articles, and videos across platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube etc. The speedy acceptance of social media has forced to an explosive growth in information-distribution among users, with fake news becoming a fundamental intrusion of our digital day-to-day life. The spread of disinformation is in part associated to social media failing to verify the correctness of a news item.

First, a subspace-based classifier sequences selection method is proposed to break DEP’s neighborhood construction limitation and avoid the exhaustive similarity calculation. Moreover, a pre-prediction mechanism is introduced to calculate the relationship between an unseen sample and data subspaces. Ultimately, the calculated relationship scores and their credibility will be used as the weights for fusion. SDEP reduces the DEP’s computational burden while retaining the dynamic characteristics through changing the classifier selection into the subspace-based classifier sequences combination.

JOUR ,,,,,"Manifold learning is a widely adopted nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique employed to discover low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional data and to explore the intrinsic data structure. It encompasses a range of nonlinear techniques, including Isomap, Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), among others. Isomap, as a popular method in manifold learning, has exhibited promising results. However, it encounters several challenges, such as the Topological Stability Problem, Shortest Path Distance, and noise sensitivity, which compromise its accuracy and elevate its computational demands. This survey paper presents three novel existing approaches to address these challenges and enhance the performance of Isomap. Firstly, the FastIsomap method, an existing approach that combines state-of-the-art algorithms like the KD tree and NN-descent to increase graph accuracy while reducing computational cost. Secondly, the FastIsomapVis method, also an existing technique, employs a hierarchical divide-and-conquer strategy employing the KD tree and Dijkstra Buckets Double, which enhances accuracy and reduces computational time in Isomap. Lastly, the NR-Isomap method, another existing approach, used the Local Tangent Space Alignment algorithm to remove noise sensitivity and short-circuit edge problems. The existing methods improve the accuracy of Isomap but also streamline its computational requirements. Furthermore, this survey paper discusses the open issues and future research directions for Isomap and manifold learning methods. It can be a valuable resource for researchers seeking insights across diverse domains.

JOUR ,,,,,"Recent work has claimed that (non-tonal) phonological patterns are subregular (Heinz 2011a,b, 2018; Heinz and Idsardi 2013), occupying a delimited proper subregion of the regular functions—the weakly deterministic (WD) functions (Heinz and Lai 2013; Jardine 2016). Whether or not it is correct (McCollum et al. 2020a), this claim can only be properly assessed given a complete and accurate definition of WD functions. We propose such a definition in this article, patching unintended holes in Heinz and Lai’s (2013) original definition that we argue have led to the incorrect classification of some phonological patterns as WD. We start from the observation that WD patterns share a property that we call unbounded semiambience, modeled after the analogous observation by Jardine (2016) about non-deterministic (ND) patterns and their unbounded circumambience. Both ND and WD functions can be broken down into compositions of deterministic (subsequential) functions (Elgot and Mezei 1965; Heinz and Lai 2013) that read an input string from opposite directions; we show that WD functions are those for which these deterministic composands do not interact in a way that is familiar from the theoretical phonology literature. To underscore how this concept of interaction neatly separates the WD class of functions from the strictly more expressive ND class, we provide analyses of the vowel harmony patterns of two Eastern Nilotic languages, Maasai and Turkana, using bimachines, an automaton type that represents unbounded bidirectional dependencies explicitly. These analyses make clear that there is interaction between deterministic composands when (and only when) the output of a given input element of a string is simultaneously dependent on information from both the left and the right: ND functions are those that involve interaction, while WD functions are those that do not.

Follow this route, typical region-based losses, such as IoU loss and Dice loss, could also be extended to weakly supervised versions in this work. Besides, considering the computational complexity of the pixel level graph cut algorithm, we use SLIC algorithm to extract superpixels as the vertices of the graph involved in our loss function. In the experiments, the network based on the proposed graph cut loss achieves good performance in VOC2012 dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our method.

JOUR ,,,,,"Continual Learning (CL) is a novel AI paradigm in which tasks and data are made available over time; thus, the trained model is computed on the basis of a stream of data. CL-based approaches are able to learn new skills and knowledge without forgetting the previous ones, with no guaranteed access to previously encountered data, and mitigating the so-called “catastrophic forgetting” phenomenon. Interestingly, by making AI systems able to learn and improve over time without the need for large amounts of new data or computational resources, CL can help at reducing the impact of computationally-expensive and energy-intensive activities; hence, CL can play a key role in the path towards more green AIs, enabling more efficient and sustainable uses of resources. In this work, we describe different methods proposed in the literature to solve CL tasks; we survey different applications, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, with a particular focus on the biomedical context. Furthermore, we discuss how to make the methods more robust and suitable for a wider range of applications.

JOUR ,,,,,"Given a data-set of Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences we can infer the phylogenetics of the samples and tackle the information for scientific purposes. Based on current data and knowledge, the SARS-CoV-2 seemingly mutates much more slowly than the influenza virus that causes seasonal flu. However, very recent evolution poses some doubts about such conjecture and shadows the out-coming light of people vaccination. This paper adopts mathematical and computational tools for handling the challenge of analyzing the data-set of different clades of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). On one hand, based on the mathematical paraphernalia of tools, the concept of distance associated with the Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theories, as well as with the Hamming scheme, are considered. On the other, advanced data processing computational techniques, such as, data compression, clustering and visualization, are borrowed for tackling the problem. The results of the synergistic approach reveal the complex time dynamics of the evolutionary process and may help to clarify future directions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. ",,,"Andrade, J. P.

JOUR ,,,,,"The dentate gyrus (DG) is crucial for distinguishing similar events through pattern separation. It has been proposed that sparse firing granule cells (GCs) perform these computational functions in the DG. GCs are the principal neurons of the DG, and it has been reported that they form a heterogeneous population, including semilunar granule cells (SGCs) and adult-born granule cells (adult-born GCs), both of which have different physiological properties from the GCs. Given their undeniable interactions with GCs, it is important to investigate how the different subpopulations of GCs contribute to pattern separation. By constructing a biologically relevant computational model of the DG, we found that SGCs and adult-born GCs can dynamically regulate pattern separation. Specifically, SGCs and 4–8-week-old adult-born GCs contribute to pattern separation. However, 0–4-week-old adult-born GCs initially increase pattern separation efficiency, then decrease it. Furthermore, SGCs and 4–8-week-old adult-born GCs enhance the sparse firing of GCs, thereby improving pattern separation efficiency. Regarding 0–4-week-old adult-born GCs, the net effect of mossy cells (MCs) on GCs shifts from inhibition to excitation as adult-born GCs mature, resulting in a decrease in pattern separation efficiency.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article investigates how certainty and timing of evidence introduction impact the uptake of evidence by policy-makers in collective deliberations. Little is known about how experts or researchers should time the introduction of uncertain evidence for policy-makers. With a computational model based on the Hegselmann–Krause opinion dynamics model, we simulate how policy-makers update their opinions in light of new evidence. We illustrate the use of our model with two examples in which timing and certainty matter for policy-making: intelligence analysts scouting potential terrorist activity and food safety inspections of chicken meat. Our computations indicate that evidence should come early to convince policy-makers, regardless of how certain it is. Even if the evidence is quite certain, it will not convince all policy-makers. Next to its substantive contribution, the article also showcases the methodological innovation that agent-based models can bring for a better understanding of the science–policy nexus. The model can be endlessly adapted to generate hypotheses and simulate interactions that cannot be empirically tested.

However, we also find that their descriptions of improvisation overemphasize the dimension of spontaneity as an intuitive “letting happen” of movements. To recalibrate their descriptions of improvisational practices, we couple Ezequiel Di Paolo, Thomas Buhrmann, and Xabier E. Barandiaran’s (2017) enactive account of the constitution of agency with case studies of two expert performers of improvisation: a dancer and a musician. Our analyses hereof show that their improvisations unfold as a sophisticated oscillation of agency between specialized forms of mental and bodily control and, indeed, a more spontaneous “letting things happen.” In all, this article’s conclusions frame thinking in movement concerning improvisational practices as contextually embedded, purposively trained, and inherently relational.

JOUR ,,,,,"The creation of machines with intelligence comparable to human beings—so-called ""human-level” and “general” intelligence—is often regarded as the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, many prominent discussions of AI lean heavily on the notion of human-level intelligence to frame AI research, but then rely on conceptions of human cognitive capacities, including “common sense,” that are sketchy, one-sided, philosophically loaded, and highly contestable. Our goal in this essay is to bring into view some underappreciated features of the practical intelligence involved in ordinary human agency. These features of practical intelligence are implicit in the structure of our first-person experience of embodied and situated agency, deliberation, and human interaction. We argue that spelling out these features and their implications reveals a fundamental distinction between two forms of intelligence in action, or what we call “efficient task-completion” versus “intelligent engagement in activity.” This distinction helps us to see what is missing from some widely accepted ways of thinking about human-level intelligence in AI, and how human common sense is actually tied, conceptually, to the ideal of practical wisdom, or good (normative) judgment about how to act and live well. Finally, our analysis, if sound, also has implications for the important ethical question of what it means to have AI systems that are aligned with human values, or the so-called “value alignment” problem for artificial intelligence.

Limitative explanations explain why certain problems cannot be solved computationally, either in principle or in practice.

JOUR ,,,,,"In his recent book, (Bias: A Philosophical Study, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2022). Thomas Kelly argues that various phenomena that look initially like examples of how irrational we are in thinking about bias—especially our own biases—turn out to be exactly what you’d expect from ideally rational agents. The phenomena he discusses which I’ll focus on are (1) our inability to introspectively identify our biases, and (2) our tendency to respond to accusations of bias with counteraccusations. In this paper, I’ll concede that Kelly is right about how ideally rational agents would think about their biases, while raising questions about whether the fact that we think similarly is best explained by our rationality. In §2, I’ll explain how Kelly’s “perspectival account of bias attributions” predicts that rational agents would be unable to identify their own biases, and would respond to accusations of bias with counter-accusations of bias. In §3, I’ll describe how a certain sort of irrational agent would behave differently—these irrational agents would respond to accusations of bias with searching introspection, and that introspection might reliably turn up evidence of bias, which would then lead them to change their views in the direction of being less biased. We are clearly not such agents, since we do exhibit (1) and (2). I’ll argue that the sort of behavior we exhibit could be explained either because we’re more rational than the agents described, or because we’re less rational than them—just as incoherent, but also worse at introspectively noticing our incoherence. I’ll argue that it’s an empirical question, to which Kelly’s arguments don’t speak, whether the fact that we exhibit (1) and (2) is best explained by our rationality, or our irrationality.

Since ecosystems are complex, difficulties in learning are often examined from a systems thinking perspective. However, challenges also arise in other areas, particularly in the application of knowledge, conceptions, and exploration of conventionalized representations of ecosystems. Hence, we aim to determine the factors that influence reasoning about ecosystems and how they interact. We conducted a thinking-aloud study with 20 students aged between nine and 12 years while reviewing a food chain ecosystem. Our results indicated that students’ reasoning was based on mixed reasoning originating from their systems thinking skills, knowledge, conceptions, and individual understanding of the ecosystem’s representation. Further, they revealed that students referred to these factors according to the individual cognitive requirements of the systems thinking skills performed and independently of their age and systems thinking abilities. Additionally, students partially demonstrated complex levels of systems thinking, but their assumptions about systems elements and relationships did not support scientific conventions. Our results indicated that systems thinking was largely guided by systems-specific patterns, as basic assumptions about systems elements and relationships played a major role in reasoning about ecosystems at all levels of systems thinking. We assume that identifying systems characteristics with the identified factors of systems-specific knowledge, conceptions, and representations are an effective blueprint for investigating challenging patterns in students’ understanding of ecosystems and advances knowledge on how systems properties influence students’ reasoning during systems thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"The pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today’s digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today’s context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to “Papert’s CT,” which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that “Wing’s CT” and “Papert’s CT,” when correctly understood, are both relevant to today’s computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science’s centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today’s world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically “transfers” to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots of CT.

In addition to participating in the study, AI—specifically OpenAI’s ChatGPT—was used to create two of the three survey instruments and served as an analysis tool for the qualitative results of this mixed-methods study. Results from the qualitative data suggest that secondary science educators are cautiously optimistic about the inclusion of AI in the classroom; however, there is a need to modify teacher preparation to incorporate AI training. Further, ethical concerns were identified about plagiarism, knowledge generation, and what constitutes original thinking with AI use. A one-way ANOVA revealed that there was a significant effect of subject taught on attitudes towards AI in the classroom p < 0.05 level for the four conditions: F(3, 23) = 6.743, p = .002. The partial eta squared of 0.47 indicates a large effect size with practical significance.

JOUR ,,,,,"Contemporary sciences, including the didactics of science, employ computational simulations as tools in their academic endeavors. The construction and application of these simulations are of interest to didactics as they contribute to shaping new perspectives on scientific activity. Consequently, they warrant special attention in conceptualizations of the nature of science. This article presents a specific characterization of Computational Simulations of Science Education (CSSE) at both the didactic and metatheoretical levels. On the didactic front, we highlight the primary scopes and limitations that arise from its implementation in the classroom. Additionally, we explore the distinctions between CSSE and Computational Simulations of the Sciences (CSS) in terms of design and structure. At the metatheoretical level, we argue, drawing mainly from van Fraassen’s insights, that CSSE, capable of yielding quantitative data, are accompanied by data models derived from measurement procedures. These models are interconnected and, in turn, intricately linked to the phenomena under investigation. These structures are subsumed within the empirical substructures of theoretical models. We posit that CSSE serve as bridges facilitating the transition toward an understanding of theoretical models and real-world phenomena through their integration into educational activities. In conclusion, this contribution expands, and updates didactic and philosophical conceptions related to the production of contemporary scientific knowledge. This, in turn, offers novel insights into the nature of science for science education.

JOUR ,,,,,"When the studies on the effectiveness of visual programming language are examined, it is seen that studies on coding teaching have been carried out frequently recently. In this study, Scratch was used as a teaching tool in teaching science lessons. In this way, a new perspective has been brought to Scratch applications. In the related study, the effects of designing science experiments with visual programming language (Scratch) on students’ beliefs of self-efficacy related to computational thinking (CT) skills, metacognitive awareness levels, and motivation levels for science learning are examined. This study was carried out using a single-group research design based on pretest and posttest applications. Students attending the fifth grade participated in this study. Sixty-five students attending the fifth grade participated in the research. Research data were obtained using “Self-Efficacy Perception Scale for CT Skills (SEP_CTS),” “Metacognitive Awareness Scale (MAS),” and “Motivation Scale for Science Learning (MSSL).” The research process is 10 weeks and 3 days in total. It was determined that designing science experiments in visual programming language applications based on Scratch improved students’ CT self-efficacy perceptions, but did not have the expected effect on students’ science learning motivation and metacognitive awareness. This research provides evidence that some skills can be improved by using Scratch as a teaching tool in different courses. With the focus of research on this subject, it can contributed to the development of new understandings of Scratch in teaching processes.

JOUR ,,,,,"Contemporary perspectives prioritize teaching core epistemic practices. It is the practice turn, which is called the science-as-practice approach. Therefore, prompting inquiry into a practical translation of curricular objectives into teaching activities for scaffolding students’ epistemic development seems essential. This study estimates the epistemic practices loads (EPLs) of Turkish elementary and middle school science curricula’ objectives released in different years: 2013, 2017, and 2018. A pattern emerges, revealing a consistent inclination towards an incremental progression from the perception (e.g., low-level interpretation) to the conception (e.g., rough induction) zone (lower-order epistemic practices), and this is followed by a diminishing orientation from the conception (e.g., thinking with models) to the causation (e.g., hypothesis testing, controlling variables) and argumentation-abstraction (e.g., evaluating, critiquing, interrogating, arguing (counter-arguing), discussing, negotiating) zones (higher-order epistemic practices) within the EPLs of the curricular objectives. The examined curricula address two principles of epistemic practices: “knowledge is proposed” and “knowledge is communicated.” However, there is a scarcity of indications related to the principles of “knowledge is evaluated” and “knowledge is legitimated,” encapsulating the social foundations of epistemic practices. A pattern was found in which the objectives of the examined curricula classify earth sciences, cosmology, and astronomy as observational rather than experimental sciences. This classification also extends to learning about living beings and life. Conversely, the epistemic standpoint of the curricula developers seems to perceive physics-related and chemistry-related topics within the context of experimental sciences.

JOUR ,,,,,"The integration of engineering practices into science education began to be explicitly promoted in the early twenty-first century and has since spread to many countries through recent curricular reforms. Despite this is fostered from the initial levels of education, there remains limited information on how to conduct it effectively in the classroom. To address this gap, a systematic review of studies published during the period 2001–2021 was conducted, focusing on the integration of engineering practices into primary education (6–12 years) science classes. A total of 24 studies were selected and analyzed to respond to how engineering practices are integrated into science classes, which engineering practices and science content are chosen, what challenges students are often faced with, and what evidence supports this curricular integration. The findings reveal that the predominant integration model is one that subordinates science to engineering learning using the project-based or design-based learning approach and teamwork. The most recurrent combination of engineering practices in the same learning situation is the one that includes “design solutions” and “obtaining, evaluating and/or communicating information,” while the use of computational thinking was not addressed in the studies analyzed. Regarding science content, studies suggest that virtually any topic can be useful to integrate engineering practices, normally aimed at designing or constructing artifacts. However, the evidence found on the educational benefits and feasibility of integrating engineering practices into primary science education shows a still inconclusive scenario. The study concludes with a discussion of its limitations and implications for future research and practice.

JOUR ,,,,,"Learning the art of any professional practice like engineering design or computer programming is a challenge for students and adds to the complexity of teaching such a technical discipline. Institutional regulations, along with industry expectations, increase the burden on the educator to develop a successful instructional environment. Critical systems thinking provides practitioners, in general, with a framework for understanding interrelation and complexities in a variety of problem situations. The art of systems thinking requires discourse on both the interdependencies, and multiple perspectives present in a problem situation. However, little guidance exists for educators in applying the concepts of critical systems thinking in their everyday practice of teaching a professional practice module at university level. This paper suggests a methodology based on action research and critical systems thinking concepts, to incorporate the art of systems thinking in the teaching of a professional practice module. The phases of action research are described from the critical systems perspective of Ulrich, in order to provide guidelines for an educator to embrace the complexity of professional practice education. Programming is used as a demonstration of the proposed methodology. The methodology incorporates systems thinking aspects such as the totality of conditioned realities, boundary critique, and acting as a witness sensitive to polemical argumentation on behalf of the affected. It demonstrates how Ulrich’s approach involves - and respects - all stakeholders in a system and guides the individual educator to excel in teaching a professional practice module. By making a conscious effort to listen to the affected and to incorporate as many conditioned realities as possible, the educator should be able to improve student engagement, resulting in better skills. We provide a demonstration of the art of teaching a professional practice module methodology which enables the educator to develop the programming skills of students in a complex environment.

It is in the framework of this eco-cognitive perspective that we can usefully analyze the recent attention in computer science devoted to the importance of the simplification of cognitive and motor tasks caused in organic entities by the morphological features: ignorant bodies can be domesticated to become useful “mimetic bodies”, that is able to render an intertwined computation simpler, resorting to that “simplexity” of animal embodied cognition, which represents one of the main quality of organic agents. Through eco-cognitive computationalism we can clearly acknowledge that the concept of computation changes, depending on historical and contextual causes, and we can build an epistemological view that illustrates the “emergence” of new kinds of computations, such as the one regarding morphological computation. This new perspective shows how the computational domestication of ignorant entities can originate new unconventional cognitive embodiments.

JOUR ,,,,,"Predictive processing framework (PP) has found wide applications in cognitive science and philosophy. It is an attractive candidate for a unified account of the mind in which perception, action, and cognition fit together in a single model. However, PP cannot claim this role if it fails to accommodate an essential part of cognition—conceptual thought. Recently, Williams (Synthese 1–27, 2018) argued that PP struggles to address at least two of thought’s core properties—generality and rich compositionality. In this paper, I show that neither necessarily presents a problem for PP. In particular, I argue that because we do not have access to cognitive processes but only to their conscious manifestations, compositionality may be a manifest property of thought, rather than a feature of the thinking process, and result from the interplay of thinking and language. Pace Williams, both of these capacities, constituting parts of a complex and multifarious cognitive system, may be fully based on the architectural principles of PP. Under the assumption that language presents a subsystem separate from conceptual thought, I sketch out one possible way for PP to accommodate both generality and rich compositionality.

JOUR ,,,,,"There is a longstanding debate between those who think that cognition extends into the external environment (extend cognition) and those who think it is located squarely within the individual (internalism). Recently, a new actor has emerged on the scene, one that looks to play kingmaker. Predictive processing (PP) says that the mind/brain is fundamentally engaged in a process of minimising the difference between what is predicted about the world and how the world actually is, what is known as ‘prediction error minimisation’ (PEM). The goal of this paper is to articulate a novel approach to extended cognition using the resources of PP. After outlining two recent proposals from Constant et al. (2020) and Kirchhoff and Kiverstein (2019), I argue that the case for extended cognition can be further developed by interpreting certain elements of the PP story (namely, PEM) as a “mark of the cognitive”. The suggestion is that when construed at an ‘algorithmic level’ PEM offers a direct route to thinking about extended systems as genuine cognitive systems. On route to articulating the proposal, I lay out the core argument, defend the proposal’s novelty, and point to several of the advantages of the formulation. Finally, I conclude by taking up two challenges raised by Hohwy (2016, 2018) about the prospects of using PEM to argue for extended cognition.

In common first-order mechanistic explanations, constitutive relevance norms are captured by the matched-interlevel-experiments condition (Craver et al. (2021) Synthese 199:8807–8828). Regarding individuation, we say that any two mechanisms are of the same type when they have the same concrete components performing the same activities in the same arrangement. By contrast, in higher-order mechanistic explanations, we formulate the decompositions in terms of generalized basic components (GBCs). These GBCs (e.g., logic gates) possess causal properties that are common to a set of physical systems. Mechanistic explanations formulated in terms of GBCs embody the epistemic value of horizontal integration, which aims to explain as many phenomena as possible with a minimal amount of abstract components (Wajnerman Paz (2017a) Philos Psychol 30:213–234). Two higher-order mechanisms are of the same type when they share all the same GBCs, and they are organized as performing the same activities with the same interactions. I use this notion of mechanistic order to enhance the mechanistic account of computation (MAC) and provide an account of the epistemic norms of computational explanation and the nature of medium-independent functional properties and mechanisms. Finally, I use these new conceptual tools to address four criticisms of the MAC.

I argue that this conceptualisation not only offers the best way of making sense of computational implementation, but also a way of resolving each of the outstanding challenges facing the mechanistic account.

This is a hugely positive development. The tools of computational cognitive neuroscience are rigorous and precise. They have the potential to prise open the black box. However, we argue that, from the perspective of a scientific realist, these tools are not yet being applied in an optimal way. To fulfil their potential, the shiny new methods of cognitive neuroscience need to be better coordinated with old-fashioned, contrastive experimental designs. Inferences from model complexity to cognitive complexity, of the kind made by those who favour lean interpretations of behaviour (‘associationists’), require social learning to be tested in challenging task environments. Inferences from cognitive complexity to social specificity, made by those who favour rich interpretations (‘mentalists’), call for non-social control experiments.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational radio frequency identification can be successfully employed in a range of applications. The efficient data dissemination is a building block for useful functions such as parameter configuration, code debug fixing, and wireless reprogramming. Many recent data dissemination protocols have adopted transmission methods from a reader to a single tag following EPC C1G2. Even if the same data need to be transmitted to multiple tags, they can only be distributed individually; however, tags in the reader antenna coverage area can hear commands from the reader, which motivates us to pursue a multicast data dissemination scheme that is compatible with the existing protocol. In this paper, we propose Lama, an efficient multicast data dissemination protocol that considers tag link characteristics (link quality and charging efficiency).

JOUR ,,,,,"Feasting on a plethora of social media platforms, news aggregators, and online marketplaces, recommender systems (RSs) are spreading pervasively throughout our daily online activities. Over the years, a host of ethical issues have been associated with the diffusion of RSs and the tracking and monitoring of users’ data. Here, we focus on the impact RSs may have on personal autonomy as the most elusive among the often-cited sources of grievance and public outcry. On the grounds of a philosophically nuanced notion of autonomy, we illustrate three specific reasons why RSs may limit or compromise it: the threat of manipulation and deception associated with RSs; the RSs’ power to reshape users’ personal identity; the impact of RSs on knowledge and critical thinking. In our view, however, notwithstanding these legitimate concerns, RSs may effectively help users to navigate an otherwise overwhelming landscape. Our perspective, therefore, is not to be intended as a bulwark to protect the status quo but as an invitation to carefully weigh these aspects in the design of ethically oriented RSs.

JOUR ,,,,,"Most of humanity’s important and difficult problems such as pandemics, environmental health, and social unrest require recognizing and understanding complex systems. Students often have difficulty understanding complex systems concepts and previous research indicates that scaffolded computer simulations may facilitate learning. Few studies, however, have investigated which types of scaffolding can help students understand complex systems concepts with simulations. This study compares ontological and self-monitoring scaffolds with an agent-based participatory simulation on mainly undergraduate students’ (N = 96) understanding of complex systems. Data sources included pretest and posttest assessments of complex systems concepts. Results revealed that students in the ontological condition significantly improved from pretest to posttest on their agent actions and processes-based causality understanding, while apparently decreasing their understanding in action effects. In addition, students in the ontological condition improved more from pre- to post-test than students in the self-monitoring condition in their understanding of order. This study highlights how scaffolded, agent-based participatory simulations can help students learn complex systems concepts and that ontological scaffolding may help students understand decentralized and emergent order within complex systems.

However, there is a lack of focus on CT and CS access for children with disabilities. This study investigates the effect of the robot development process at the secondary school level on the algorithmic thinking and mental rotation skills of students with learning disabilities (LD). The study was conducted with the single-subject model and as an A-B-A design. In the study, the CT skill development of four students with LD (1 female, 3 male) was monitored throughout 13 weeks with the pre-treatment sessions running from weeks 1–4, treatment sessions running from weeks 5–9, and post-treatment sessions running from weeks 10–13. During the treatment sessions, robot design and programming implementations were performed. During these 13 sessions, the observer scored participants’ both algorithmic problem-solving and mental rotation skills. These skills are also required to use some other cognitive sub-skills (i.e., selective attention, processing speed) which were defined by ten special education experts at the beginning of the study. All these skills were evaluated according to how well the students performed the following four criteria: (1) To start to perform the instructions quickly (processing speed), (2) to focus on the task by filtering out distractions (selective attention), (3) to fulfill the task without having to have the instructions repeated, (4) to perform algorithmic problem-solving/mental rotation tasks without any help. Considering the results on the participants’ algorithmic problem-solving skills, a significant improvement was obtained in their skills after the treatment process. The improvement obtained in the participants’ mental rotation skills is another important result of the study. Considering the study results from a holistic perspective, it can be concluded that the robot development implementation, as educational technology, can be used to support the cognitive development of students with learning disabilities.

Models have been used as a pivotal science and engineering tool to investigate, represent, explain, and predict phenomena or solve problems that involve multi-faceted systems across many fields. To fully explain complex phenomena or solve problems using models requires both systems thinking (ST) and computational thinking (CT). This study proposes a theoretical framework that uses modeling as a way to integrate ST and CT. We developed a framework to guide the complex process of developing curriculum, learning tools, support strategies, and assessments for engaging learners in ST and CT in the context of modeling. The framework includes essential aspects of ST and CT based on selected literature, and illustrates how each modeling practice draws upon aspects of both ST and CT to support explaining phenomena and solving problems.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article concerns the synergy between science learning, understanding complexity, and computational thinking (CT), and their impact on near and far learning transfer. The potential relationship between computer-based model construction and knowledge transfer has yet to be explored. We studied middle school students who modeled systemic phenomena using the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform. A distinct innovation of this work is the complexity-based visual epistemic structure underpinning the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform, which guided students' modeling of complex systems. This epistemic structure suggests that a complex system can be described and modeled by defining entities and assigning them (1) properties, (2) actions, and (3) interactions with each other and with their environment. In this study, we investigated students’ conceptual understanding of science, systems understanding, and CT. We also explored whether the complexity-based structure is transferable across different domains. The study employs a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest-control comparison-group design, with 26 seventh-grade students in an experimental group, and 24 in a comparison group. Findings reveal that students who constructed computational models significantly improved their science conceptual knowledge, systems understanding, and CT. They also showed relatively high degrees of transfer—both near and far—with a medium effect size for the far transfer of learning. For the far-transfer items, their explanations included entities’ properties and interactions at the micro level. Finally, we found that learning CT and learning how to think complexly contribute independently to learning transfer, and that conceptual understanding in science impacts transfer only through the micro-level behaviors of entities in the system. A central theoretical contribution of this work is to offer a method for promoting far transfer. This method suggests using visual epistemic scaffolds of the general thinking processes we would like to support, as shown in the complexity-based structure on the MMM interface, and incorporating these visual structures into the core problem-solving activities.

JOUR ,,,,,"The short evolution of 6G and augmented reality (AR) technology heralds a transformative era in education and training, promising to redefine traditional learning paradigms using immersive, interactive reports. This paper explores the integration of advanced capsule networks (CapsNet) architectures with semantic segmentation techniques to cope with the inherent annoying conditions of applying 6G and AR in academic contexts. CapsNets, well known for its efficiency in discerning spatial hierarchies and relationships, are paired with semantic segmentation to enhance object recognition and interplay within AR environments. It offers a deep, contextual understanding essential for growing dynamic, personalised learning studies. The synergy among this technology allows for the unique delineation and classification of each image pixel into corresponding object training, facilitating seamless interaction among virtual content and the real world. Need of the highly dependable, low-latency communication exchange skills of 6G, this combination guarantees powerful processing of complex scenes in real-time, crucial for preserving student engagement and facilitating adaptive learning pathways. The paper discusses optimisation techniques for real-time performance, including version pruning and effective routing mechanisms, to cope with the computational needs of CapsNets and semantic segmentation. Moreover, it highlights the role of 6G in assisting the bandwidth and latency necessities critical for deploying these state-of-the-art AI models in AR-based instructional programs. Through this integration, we aim to release new potentials for personalised, context-aware learning experiences, which can considerably enhance knowledge retention, engagement, and accessibility in education and training across various fields.

JOUR ,,,,,"Due to high impact of internet technology and rapid change in software systems, it has been a tough challenge for us to detect software defects with high accuracy. Traditional software defect prediction research mainly concentrates on manually designing features (e.g., complexity metrics) and inputting them into machine learning classifiers to distinguish defective code. To gain high prediction accuracy, researchers have developed several deep learning or high computational models for software defect prediction. However, there are several critical conditions and theoretical problems in order to achieve better results. This article explores the investigation of SDP using two deep learning techniques, i.e., SqueezeNet and Bottleneck models. We employed seven different open-source datasets from NASA Repository to perform this comparative study. We use F-Measure as a performance evaluator and found that these methods statistically outperform eight state-of-the-art methods with mean F-Measure of 0.93 ± 0.014 and 0.90 ± 0.013, respectively. We found that these two methods are significantly more effective in terms of F-Measure over large- and moderate-size projects. But they are computationally expensive in terms of training time.

However, the adsorption study in multicomponent systems provides important conclusions of the concentration effect of the metal ions, showing a significant antagonistic and competitive effect of both ions under equivalent concentrations of them (qPb2+ is 56% reduced) or high concentration of Pb2+ (qCu2+ is 50% reduced). Computational results correlated well with the experimental ones and evidenced all interactions proposed from spectroscopy results, accounting for the occurrence of complexation and electrostatic mechanisms between metal ions and the surface oxygenated functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carboxylate) onto chili seed. Chemistry quantum descriptors supported the reactivity behavior of the chemical species implicated.

JOUR ,,,,,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is an established and common cardiovascular risk factor for falls. An in-depth understanding of the various interacting pathophysiological pathways contributing to OH-related falls is essential to guide improvements in diagnostic and treatment opportunities. We applied systems thinking to multidisciplinary map out causal mechanisms and risk factors. For this, we used group model building (GMB) to develop a causal loop diagram (CLD). The GMB was based on the input of experts from multiple domains related to OH and falls and all proposed mechanisms were supported by scientific literature. Our CLD is a conceptual representation of factors involved in OH-related falls, and their interrelatedness. Network analysis and feedback loops were applied to analyze and interpret the CLD, and quantitatively summarize the function and relative importance of the variables. Our CLD contains 50 variables distributed over three intrinsic domains (cerebral, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal), and an extrinsic domain (e.g., medications). Between the variables, 181 connections and 65 feedback loops were identified. Decreased cerebral blood flow, low blood pressure, impaired baroreflex activity, and physical inactivity were identified as key factors involved in OH-related falls, based on their high centralities. Our CLD reflects the multifactorial pathophysiology of OH-related falls. It enables us to identify key elements, suggesting their potential for new diagnostic and treatment approaches in fall prevention. The interactive online CLD renders it suitable for both research and educational purposes and this CLD is the first step in the development of a computational model for simulating the effects of risk factors on falls.

However, this “memory-centric” common understanding has a humble beginning. More than three decades ago, the memory-bounded speedup model is the first model recognizing memory as the bound of computing and provided a general bound of speedup and a computing-memory trade-off formulation. The memory-bounded model was well received even by then. It was immediately introduced in several advanced computer architecture and parallel computing textbooks in the 1990’s as a must-know for scalable computing. These include Prof. Kai Hwang’s book “Scalable Parallel Computing” in which he introduced the memory-bounded speedup model as the Sun-Ni’s Law, parallel with the Amdahl’s Law and the Gustafson’s Law. Through the years, the impacts of this model have grown far beyond parallel processing and into the fundamental of computing. In this article, we revisit the memory-bounded speedup model and discuss its progress and impacts in depth to make a unique contribution to this special issue, to stimulate new solutions for big data applications, and to promote data-centric thinking and rethinking.

This work explores these problems and presents multiple scaffolds to promote Self-regulation of Learning (SRL), co-regulation, and socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) embedded within a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed with students (n = 71) enrolled in an online introductory programming course. Students were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) SRL-only support, 2) SRL, co-regulation, and SSRL support, and 3) a no support control group. The findings revealed that students who received regulatory support achieved higher course grades than the control group. However, only students who received SSRL and co-regulation support achieved superior performance in collaborative activities, confirming the importance of this type of regulation. Even though students did not increase in SRL aptitude, the intervention provided support for achieving higher grades in the course.

JOUR ,,,,,"A key commitment of computer-supported collaborative learning research is to study how people learn in collaborative settings to guide development of methods for capture and design for learning. Computer-supported collaborative learning research has a tradition of studying how the physical world plays a part in collaborative learning. Within the field, a material turn is emerging that considers how digital and tangible technologies actively contribute to collaborative learning processes. Studying how tangible materials produce collaborative learning visibly and algorithmically is particularly important at a time when advanced algorithms are integrated into educational contexts in ways that are not always transparent. However, the needed methodologies for capturing how non-human agents take part in collaborative learning remains underdeveloped. The present study builds on current CSCL research that investigates materials in collaborative learning and introduces posthumanist perspectives with the aim to decenter humans methodologically and to probe empirically whether and how these perspectives contribute to empirical understanding of collaborative learning processes. Taking fiber crafts (e.g., weaving and fabric manipulation) as a context for computational learning, the present study conducted a posthumanist analysis of differences among human and non-human participants in collaboration using video data to investigate how middle school youths and fiber craft components performed algorithms over time. The findings show how both youths and craft materials actively contributed to the performance of algorithms. In weaving, algorithms became repeated youth-material movements one dimension at a time. In fabric manipulation, algorithms became a repeated confluence of component parts. Decentering humans through an analysis of differences among human and non-human introduced human-material collaboration as a productive unit of analysis for understanding how materials and people together contribute to producing what can be recognized as computational performance. The findings of this research contribute to ongoing conversations in CSCL research on how computational materials can be considered in collaborative learning and present a new approach to capture collaborative learning as physical expansion over time. The study has implications for future research on capturing collaborative computational learning and designing physical computational learning opportunities that show technology as evolving.

JOUR ,,,,,"Fostering students’ dialogic reflection in the classroom entails promoting diverse perspectives and collaborative aspects of reflective thinking. However, few studies have developed visualisation tools to create a collaborative environment that fosters dialogic reflection, especially for young learners. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of visualising classroom discourse to enhance students’ dialogic reflection. Two information and communication technology (ICT) teachers and their students (n = 53) from a Hong Kong primary school participated in a 3-month study. After engaging in visualisation-supported dialogic reflection, students’ subject knowledge of ICT improved, accompanied by an increase in the proportion of words spoken by students during lessons. Interviews with the two teachers and eight students underscored the positive impact of visualising classroom discourse, which enabled students to embrace alternative problem-solving approaches and actively engage in both collaborative group work and whole-class discussions. This study illuminates the advantages of employing classroom discourse visualisation as a reflective tool. Beyond mere revisiting, students can view experiences from multiple perspectives and reconstruct their knowledge. Furthermore, this approach fostered accountability for students’ contribution during classroom interactions, ultimately improving their learning outcomes. These findings advocate for the development of evidence-based, dialogic reflective tools specifically designed for young learners to optimise their learning experiences.

Our results show that teaching programming by using a robot significantly improved computational thinking and creativity. Computational thinking, however, was not significantly improved in the group that initially showed high scores. Further, creativity was improved more in girls than in boys, and the mean difference was statistically significant, but the difference in computational thinking was not.

The experiment we conducted included the following task sequence: Q1–2, s1, Q3, s2, Q4, s3, Q5, s4, Q6, s5, Q7, s6, Q8–9. We focused on assessing the motivational contributions of the generated (situational factors) emotions, challenge and active involvement during the e-learning experience. Research results revealed that there are no unbridgeable differences in the way these two groups relate to e-learning processes that aim to promote computational thinking. Although sciences-oriented students’ motivational-scores were consistently superior to their humanities-oriented colleagues, there was strong correlation between them; furthermore, differences diminished as both groups advanced with their learning tasks.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first present a methodological framework for the analysis of embodied interaction with technology captured through video recording. The framework brings together a social semiotic approach to multimodality with the philosophical and theoretical roots of embodied cognition. We then demonstrate the application of the framework by exploring how the computational thinking of two fifth grade learners emerged as an embodied phenomenon during an educational robotics activity. The findings suggest that, for young children, computational thinking was extended to include the structures in the environment and guided by their embodiment of mathematical concepts. Specifically, the participants repeatedly used their bodies to simulate different possibilities for action while incorporating both perceptual and formal multiplicative reasoning strategies to conceptualize the robot’s movements. Implications for the design of embodied educational robotics activities and future application of the methodological framework are discussed.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill and an analytical ability that children in the twenty-first century should develop. Students should begin to work with algorithmic problem-solving and computational methods in K-12. Drawing on a conceptual framework (IGGIA) that combines CT and problem-solving, this study designed and implemented an interdisciplinary Scratch course in a primary school, examined the impact of the new problem-solving instructional approach (the adapted IGGIA) on pupils’ CT skills and self-efficacy, and explored the gender differences in these two aspects. A pretest–posttest nonequivalent group design was conducted among 63 fifth-grade students in two computer science classes over 14 weeks. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the administration of CT scales, Scratch artifacts analysis and focus group interviews. The results revealed that the adapted IGGIA (1) significantly improved the CT skills of primary school students; (2) had a significant positive impact on pupils’ CT self-efficacy, especially on their critical thinking, algorithmic thinking and problem-solving; and (3) significantly enhanced girls’ CT skills and self-efficacy. These findings indicated that problem-solving instructional approaches could promote both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of students’ deeper computational learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"Social learning theory posits that learning is most effective when providing learners with opportunities to observe and interact with peers. Unfortunately, current K-12 programming education overemphasizes individual learning and discourages learners from observing and interacting with others. The Scratch online community provides youth opportunities to actively participate in the community by allowing them to observe and interact with others. However, it is unclear what motivates learners’ active participation in the Scratch online community. With a large-scale database with more than two hundred thousand Scratch projects, this study explored the impact of the computational thinking reflected in Scratch projects on users’ participation. We examined Scratch’s online users’ computational thinking profile via clustering analysis on the projects they created, then studied the influence of computational thinking level reflected in projects on the users’ participation through causal analysis. The clustering analysis revealed three clusters of learners, and the advanced learners did not create more projects than others but their projects attract more participation from peers. Our statistic analysis finds a low to moderate strength of correlation between the computational thinking level reflected in projects and their popularity. However, the further causal analysis suggests that the computational thinking level reflected in projects fails to causally affect learners’ participation. Our results suggest that instructors should not only attach importance to the development of basic CT skills of youth but also do well to find ways to get youth to participate actively in social interaction activity during the programming process.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper presents a game-design workshop built around a digital art installation featuring video games displayed over a real-world skyscraper to stimulate students' interest in computer science and a study testing its short-term effects on improving middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and attitudes towards computing. Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop. ",,,"Lee, Frank J.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study investigated how a computer science (CS) problem-based curriculum impacted elementary students’ CS learning and attitudes. Four sixth-grade teachers and 200 of their students participated in the study. Researchers developed a CS curriculum in collaboration with the teachers, which consisted of two main units: (1) an introduction to block-based coding and (2) a problem-based learning (PBL) applied coding project. Overall, students significantly improved their knowledge of CT concepts after the introductory block-based coding lessons and retained that knowledge after completing the PBL activities approximately three months later. Results suggest that Event and Parallelism were challenging concepts for most of the students, whereas Loop and Sequence were easily grasped by most of the students. Further analysis based on prior knowledge levels revealed that the high-prior knowledge (HK) group outperformed the low-prior knowledge (LK) group on every measure. However, LK narrowed the gap of CT concepts after the introductory block-based coding lessons. Students also communicated relatively positive attitudes towards CS at the conclusion of the PBL unit. These results provide support for further exploring the integration of inquiry-oriented instructional strategies such as PBL to support CS instruction.

JOUR ,,,,,"In most middle schools, learning is segregated by discipline. Yet interdisciplinary approaches have been shown to cultivate creative thinking, support problem solving, and develop interest while supporting knowledge gains (NAE & NRC in STEM Integration in K-12 Education: Status, Prospects, and an Agenda for Research. National Academies Press, Washington, 2014). The Designing Biomimetic Robots project emphasizes problem-based learning to integrate engineering, science, and computational thinking (CT). During a 3 to 4-week unit, students study the natural world to learn how animals accomplish different tasks, then design a robot inspired by what they learned. The project engages students in science, engineering, and CT practices. Over the course of a 3-year project, we used a design-based research approach to: (1) identify and describe strategies and challenges that emerge from integrated curriculum design, (2) explicate how a balance of integrated disciplines can provide opportunities for student participation in science, engineering, and CT practices, and (3) explore how a technology design task can support students’ participation in integrated learning. Data from three focal groups (one from each year of the project) suggest that a focused design task, supported by explicit and targeted supports for science, CT, and engineering practices, led to a student technology design process that was driven by disciplinary understanding. This work highlights the importance of drawing out and prioritizing alignments between disciplines (Barber in Educ Des, 2(8), 2015), to enable integrated learning. Additionally, this work demonstrates how a technology design task can support student learning across disciplines, and how engaging in CT practices can further help students draw these connections.

JOUR ,,,,,"STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) refers to the cross-disciplinary learning design for engaging students in applying integrated knowledge to complete a project or solve a complex problem. It has been recognized by many scholars for its educational significance. However, STEM tasks are generally complex and challenging to students. Without proper supports, not only will students’ participation decrease, but their knowledge level and internal capabilities will also hardly improve. To help students understand teachers’ rating standards, increase the opportunity to observe and receive feedback on peers’ work, and improve their cognitive level and higher order thinking such as critical thinking, this study proposes a peer assessment-facilitated STEM (PA-STEM) approach. At the same time, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior high school in Taiwan to verify the effectiveness of this approach. A total of four classes of 112 students participated in the experiment. The experimental group (two classes with 53 students) learning with the PA-STEM approach, and the control group (two classes with 59 students) used the conventional STEM approach. The experimental results showed that the students in the experimental group had higher learning achievement. Their collaboration tendency, critical thinking awareness, problem-solving tendency, and meta-cognition tendency were all significantly better than those of the students in the control group. Besides, peer assessment scores were highly correlated with teacher assessment scores, indicating that students were able to fully understand teachers’ rating standards and provide accurate ratings of their peers’ STEM work.

JOUR ,,,,,"Existing computational thinking (CT) research focuses on programming in K-12 education; however, there are challenges in introducing it into the formal disciplines. Therefore, we propose the introduction of non-programming plugged learning in mathematics to develop students’ CT. The research and teaching teams collaborated to develop an instructional design for primary school students. The participants were 112 third- and fourth-grade students (aged 9–10) who took part in three rounds of experiments. In this paper, we present an iterative problem-solving process in design-based implementation research, focusing on the implementation issues that lead to the design principles in the mathematics classroom. The computational tasks, environment, tools, and practices were iteratively improved over three rounds to incorporate CT effectively into mathematics. Results from the CT questionnaire demonstrated that the new program could significantly improve students’ CT abilities and compound thinking. The results of the post-test revealed that CT, including the sub-dimensions of decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving improved threefold compared to the pre-test between the three rounds, indicating that strengthened CT design enhanced CT perceptions. Similarly, the students’ and teacher’ interviews confirmed their positive experiences with CT. Based on empirical research, we summarize design characteristics from computational tasks, computational environment and tools, and computational practices and propose design principles. We demonstrate the potential of non-programming plugged learning for developing primary school students’ CT in mathematics.

More curricula and assessments, however, are needed to cultivate and measure CT for different learning goals. Maker activities have the potential to improve student CT, but more validated assessments are needed for maker activities. We developed a set of activities for students to improve and assess essential CT skills by creating real-life applications using Arduino, a microcontroller often used in maker activities. We examined the psychometric features of CT performance assessments with rubrics and the effectiveness of the maker activities on improving CT. Two high school physics teachers implemented these Arduino activities and assessments with fifteen high school students during three days in a summer program. The participating students took an internal content-involved and an external CT tests before and after participating in the program. The students also took the performance-based CT assessment at the end of the program. The data provide reliability and validity evidence of the Arduino assessment as a tool to measure CT. The pre- and post-test comparison indicates that students significantly improved their scores on the content-involved assessment aligned with the Arduino activities, but not on the content-free CT assessment.

This study tested the effects of playing a blocked-based programming educational game implemented with in-game cognitive supports on students’ ability to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) skills in near and far transfer tasks. With 79 students randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the control group received basic game supports and the treatment group received cognitive supports in addition to the basic game supports. After two hours of total gameplay over the course of four days, both groups performed equally well, and students’ CT skills were improved significantly at the near transfer level but not at the far transfer level. Students in the control condition performed significantly better on far transfer compared to the students in the treatment condition. Regression analyses indicated that the overall use of the cognitive supports was infrequent, but the amount of time spent voluntarily using cognitive supports with help on goal setting and worked examples predicted far transfer performance. How students use the cognitive supports (subverting the use of cognitive support to conscientiously learn the computational skill by using them more as game cheat sheets) might explain these findings.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students’ understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n = 21) and the control (n = 26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students’ CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students’ CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.

JOUR ,,,,,"Echoing the increasing emphasis on STEM literacy, computational thinking has become a national priority in K-12 schools. Scholars have acknowledged abstraction as the keystone of computational thinking. To foster K-12 students’ computational thinking and STEM literacy, students’ ability to think abstractly should be enhanced. However, the existing curriculum in K-12 education may not adequately equip learners with the proper abstraction needed for the STEM workforce. Given the absence of a synthesized understanding of abstraction, effective instructional guidance for fostering student abstraction is also elusive. To overcome the gap in understanding abstraction, we attempted to conceptualize a synthesized framework of abstraction in computational thinking and proposed a set of design guidelines that may enhance students’ uptake of abstraction. In this paper, we describe the importance of abstraction in computational thinking and existing challenges in developing students’ ability to perform abstraction. Then, by reviewing the cognitive dimensions of abstraction and the role of abstraction in computing education, we identify three cognitive processes underlying abstraction in computational thinking (e.g., filtering information, locating similarities, and mapping problem structures). We thereby propose a conceptual framework of abstraction in computational thinking. Finally, design guidelines for fostering abstraction in computational thinking are provided with illustrated examples of a tailored STEM-integrative learning environment.

JOUR ,,,,,"This experimental investigation seeks to confirm and extend previous investigations that resource interdependence vs. independence during problem-solving relatively extends the problem representation phase before convergence on a solution. In this current investigation, ninth-grade Korean native language participants (n = 240) worked online to complete either a well-structured or an ill-structured problem in either independent triads where all of the members were provided with all of the information needed to solve the problem, or in interdependent triads where members were each provided with different portions of the information needed. The discussions were analyzed using a content analysis rubric from Engelmann and Hesse (JAMA 5:299–319, 2010), and knowledge structures were elicited as concept maps and essays and then analyzed using a graph-theoretic psychometric network scaling approach. Analysis of transcripts of the triad interactions showed a similar pattern of divergence and then convergence for the well-structured and the ill-structured problems that confirmed the previous investigations. As anticipated, interdependent triads performed relatively better on the ill-structured problem perhaps due to the extended divergence phase, while independent triads were better on the well-structured problem perhaps due to a rapid transition to the convergence phase. Knowledge structure analysis of group maps shows that the interdependent triad maps resembled the fully explicated problem space, while the independent triad maps most resembled the narrow problem solution space. Suggestions for practice include first increasing students’ awareness of divergent and convergent thinking, allowing enough time for the activity, and also requiring teams to submit a problem space artifact before working on a solution.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) has permeated primary and early childhood education in recent years. Despite the extensive effort in CT learning initiatives, few age-appropriate assessment tools targeting young children have been developed. In this study, we proposed Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primary (CTtLP), which was designed for lower primary school students (aged 6–10). Based on the evidence-centred design approach, a set of constructed-response items that are independent of programming platforms was developed. To validate the test, content validation was first performed via expert review and cognitive interviews, and refinements were made based on the comments. Then, a large-scale field test was administered with a sample of 1st–3rd graders (N = 1225), and the data was used for psychometric analysis based on both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). The CTT results provided robust criterion validity, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability values. Regarding IRT results, a three-parameter logistic model was selected according to the item fit indices, based on which fair item parameters and test information reliability were generated. Overall, the test items and the whole scale showed proper fit, suggesting that CTtLP was a suitable test for the target group. Analyses of the test performance were then put forward. Results reported that students’ performance improved with grade level, and no gender difference was detected. Based on the test responses, we also identified children’s challenges in understanding CT constructs, indicating that students tended to have difficulty in understanding loop control and executing multiple directions. The study provides a rigorously validated diagnostic test for measuring CT acquisition in lower primary school students and demonstrates a replicable design and validation process for future assessment practices, and findings on the difficulties children faced in CT conceptual understanding could shed light on CT primary and early childhood education.

However, despite the prevalence of and demand for these games, little is known about the effectiveness of their design or about the principles that are conducive to learning using these games. In this article, we present a project in which we triangulated design research with controlled experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of a computational puzzle design (CPD) framework in guiding the development of CT teaching games for children. Using CT tests, game logs, and a survey, we evaluated the learning outcomes of and engagement with various versions of the game LittleWorld, designed based on various principles of the CPD framework and implemented in Chinese elementary education (n = 202). The results validate the CPD framework and demonstrate that it is a practical and systematic tool for designing CT teaching games.

However, focusing only on the programming learning approach itself is insufficient. Therefore, the influences of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence factors on CT skills were also examined. 121 students from China were divided into four experimental and one control groups and engaged in the programming activities intervention for 10 weeks. The data consisted mainly of students’ CT skill scores before and after the programming activities intervention. The results showed that both single and mixed programming approaches significantly improved students’ CT skills, with the mixed programming approaches being more effective. Furthermore, the study found that the implementation of unplugged activities in the first stage attenuated the effects of programming experience. Furthermore, it was found that the unplugged-first programming approach was able to diminish the effect of students’ programming experience on the development of CT skills and could be an essential condition to promote the development of equal CT skills. We also clarified the important role of programming interest and programming confidence in students’ CT development. More importantly, a chain mediation effect of programming experience and programming interest between programming confidence and CT was also found. Finally, this study further discusses ideas and approaches for the future of CT education for primary school students and provides certain practical suggestions and insights for teachers and researchers.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the current era where computational literacy holds significant relevance, a growing number of schools across the globe have placed emphasis on K-12 programming education. This field of education primarily comprises two distinct modalities—the block-based programming modality (BPM) and the text-based programming modality (TPM). Previous research may not have provided a complete understanding of the differences between these two modalities as it did not take into account both the learning process and learning outcomes. This study aimed to compare secondary students’ programming behaviors, computational thinking skills, and attitudes toward programming between the two modalities through a quasi-experimental design in a Chinese secondary school. The findings showed that (1) learners in TPM encountered more syntactical errors and spent more time between two clicks of debugging, while learners in BPM had more code-changing behaviors by adjusting programming blocks, made more attempts of debugging, and had more irrelevant behaviors; (2) learners in BPM achieved a higher level of computational thinking skills; (3) learners in both modalities experienced a slight decrease in confidence and enjoyment, while learners in BPM had higher interest levels in programming. (4) Code Changer, Minimal Debugger, Maximal Debugger, Distracted Coder and Average Coder were identified through students’ programming behavior in the two programming modalities, and differences in their CT skills and attitudinal data were revealed.

JOUR ,,,,,"Due to its task-based, gamified, and interactive features, unplugged programming activity has been widely employed in education and teaching as an activity away from electronic screens and other digital devices. There is ongoing debate over how to help K-9 pupils develop their computational thinking through unplugged programming activities. Based on findings from 15 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted domestically and abroad between 2006 and 2023, this study adopts meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the influence of unplugged programming activities on K-9 students’ computational thinking, focusing on an in-depth analysis of variables such as different students’ grade, gender, experimental period, research discipline, and unplugged programming activities categories. The results show that unplugged programming activity has a positive effect on the computational thinking of K-9 students (Hedges’ g = .631, 95% CI .463,  .799, P < .001), and its promotion effect is affected by the variables such as students’ grade, learning time, subjects studied, and unplugged programming activities categories. Based on the conclusions of the meta-analysis, this paper proposes several suggestions. For example, it suggests paying attention to the cultivation of computational thinking among middle school students, and mastering the appropriate timing for unplugged programming activities to avoid the plateau effect. Additionally, it recommends strengthening the integration of unplugged programming activities across different disciplines, as well as promoting the use of storytelling and collaborative unplugged programming activities in the classroom.

Most importantly, it emphasized the following points: (a) the most popular subject areas in CT literature; (b) CT intervention tools; (c) CT assessment practices used so far within educational courses; and (d) effective CT approaches to influence pre-service teachers. Results from this review revealed that CT’s promotion in education had achieved significant progress in recent years. Along with the growth in the number of CT studies, the number of subjects, research questions, and teaching approaches also increased in recent years. It was also found that CT was mostly used in science, mathematics, programming, and computer science tasks, with little work in artificial intelligence (AI) and non-STEM areas.

JOUR ,,,,,"A majority of research in Computational Thinking (CT) mainly focuses on teaching coding to school students. However, CT involves more than just coding and includes other skills like algorithmic thinking. The current study developed an Online Inquiry-based Learning Platform for Computational Thinking (CT-ONLINQ) that follows Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) pedagogy to support CT activities. IBL-based CT steps include algorithm design, analysis, and comparison of algorithms. Also, the platform allows students to explore multiple solutions to a problem and provides multiple-try feedback with hints as support during problem-solving activities. The hint generation strategy uses a Knowledge Graph that captures knowledge about the problem's solution in a machine-processible form. A six-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of multiple-try feedback with hints on students’ CT skills. The study included 79 high school students: 41 students as part of the experimental group (EG) were provided problem-specific hints, and 38 as part of the control group (CG) with CT-general hints. The results showed that the students in the EG group improved their CT skills significantly more than those in the CG group. In addition, the study also evaluates the effectiveness of intervention considering biases in gender and prior coding experience. Female students performed better than male students in both groups after the intervention. Furthermore, in EG group, observations showed that students without coding experience performed better than their counterparts with experience. The findings suggest that the IBL-based CT activity on CT-ONLINQ can be deployed to improve the CT skills of school students.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking is acknowledged as an essential competency for everyone to learn. However, teachers find it challenging to implement the existing learning approaches in K-12 settings because the existing approaches often focus on teaching computing concepts and skills (i.e., programming skills) rather than on helping students develop their computational thinking competency—a competency that can be used across disciplinary boundaries in accordance with curriculum requirements. To address this need, the current study investigated how game-based learning influenced middle school students’ learning processes, particularly on the development of computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking, and engagement during gameplay. Additionally, the study examined how these outcomes were moderated by individual differences. We observed evidence that the gaming experience influenced students’ computational thinking self-efficacy, but not computational thinking competency or game-based engagement. Compared to age (grade) and prior gaming experience, gender tended to play a more important role in moderating students’ computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking competency, and game-based engagement. Implications and possible directions for future research regarding using game-based learning to enhance computational thinking competency are discussed.

JOUR ,,,,,"E-textiles provide an interesting field of research as they “blend traditional craft with modern science” (Peppler, 2016) and help learners “broaden their own perceptions of computing” (Searle et al., 2016). Despite the promising findings by primarily long-term interventions structured around e-textiles, educational curriculum reform has been slow to materialize. Educators who embrace a STEAM philosophy are more likely to endorse short workshops, integrating them in existing courses or initiatives; this could serve as a steppingstone for longer interventions and bottom-up curriculum reform. This study examines whether shorter e-textile workshops (lasting four hours) can result in significant gains in understanding. We present an investigation of e-textiles with 22 young children who have no prior experience with e-textiles or working with microprocessors. We present details of our learning design, as well as findings related to circuitry knowledge and computational making skills. We find that the children advanced their circuitry knowledge and practice a range of computational making skills. We further document a series of emerging challenges, including the children’s unwillingness to engage or lack of adeptness with software, a tension between aesthetics and construction, creativity limited by samples of previous e-textile projects, and the difficulty in grasping the materiality of e-textiles. We propose that some direct instruction and facilitation is not incompatible with the making ethos; the approach can help address these challenges, allowing young children to benefit from their participation in short-duration e-textile workshops.

However, it is a challenging task to accurately measure the CT levels of the students. The goal of this study is to explore a new CT assessment paradigm that combines a data-driven approach with evidence-based reasoning, and to verify the reliability and validity of this paradigm through an empirical study. Specifically, we examined middle school students’ CT by adopting an Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) approach. We first developed a CT evaluation framework based on ECD which included student, task, and evidence models. We then created several simulation-based tasks to gather evidence of CT levels; with these tasks, we extracted the observable variables in ECD model from clickstream data during the students’ answer process. Finally, a Bayesian network model was used for CT level prediction. Findings suggest that students’ clickstream data provide fine-grained, time-variant information on their interactions with tasks, thus promising more objective and richer insight into the performances of students with different CT levels. This study provides a paradigm reference for future CT measurement studies and proposes ideas for using process data in teaching to promote students’ CT development.

To achieve an integrated computational literacy CT research must study new approaches that from the one side utilize multiple computational tools beyond traditional programming, such as databases and modelling tools, and from the other side employ CT for dealing with both the scientific and the societal aspects of real-world problems. To this end, this article explores the development of 16 middle school students’ computational thinking practices as they collaboratively play and modify the socio-scientific simulation game “CT-Chef” with three interconnected affordances, i.e., map design, data editing and block-based programming, in “ChoiCo” environment. The in-depth thematic analysis of students’ interactions throughout the activities, revealed new, system and data related, dimensions of known CT practices that have not yet been explored or detected in traditional programming-centred approaches. Moreover, the results showed that the progressive transition of student roles from players to designers enabled the development of abstract reasoning about the simulation game system. Finally, as designers of the socio-scientific game content, students questioned, discussed and modified the subjective societal values and possible biases behind the simulation.

JOUR ,,,,,"In artificial intelligence (AI) for science, the AI-empowered topology optimization methods have garnered sustained attention from researchers and achieved significant development. In this paper, we introduce the implicit neural representation (INR) from AI and the material point method (MPM) from the field of computational mechanics into topology optimization, resulting in a novel differentiable and fully mesh-independent topology optimization framework named MI-TONR, and it is then applied to nonlinear topology optimization (NTO) design. Within MI-TONR, the INR is combined with the topology description function to construct the design model, while implicit MPM is employed for physical response analysis. A skillful integration is achieved between the design model based on the continuous implicit representation field and the analysis model based on the Lagrangian particles. Along with updating parameters of the neural network (i.e., design variables), the structural topologies iteratively evolve according to the responses analysis results and optimization functions. The computational differentiability is ensured at every step of MI-TONR, enabling sensitivity analysis using automatic differentiation. In addition, we introduce the augmented Lagrangian Method to handle multiple constraints in topology optimization and adopt a learning rate adaptive adjustment scheme to enhance the robustness of the optimization process. Numerical examples demonstrate that MI-TONR can effectively conduct NTO design under large loads without any numerical techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities. Meanwhile, its natural satisfaction with the no-penetration condition facilitates the NTO design of considering contact. The infinite spatial resolution characteristic facilitates the generation of structural topology at multiple resolutions with clear and continuous boundaries.

Additionally, a gender gap in community service attitudes exists, with female students displaying more favorable views towards service than male students. The study also shows that first year students demonstrated a stronger positive assessment of benefits from community service compared to senior students. These findings suggest that in the Chinese context, SL’s impact on students’ sense of broader civic responsibility, empathetic understanding, and overall assessment of the costs and benefits of serving the community is more intricate and varies across student groups. The study concludes with recommendations for future SL program design and implementation strategies, emphasizing the importance of addressing the identified gaps in civic and empathy areas.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the recent years, there has been a push to engage primary and secondary students in computer science to prepare them to live and work in a world influenced by computation. One of the efforts involves getting primary and secondary students to think computationally by introducing computational ideas such as, algorithms and abstraction. Majority of this work around computational thinking has focused on the use of digital technologies, in particular programming environments (Yadav, Stephenson, and Hong 2017). In today’s highly digitalized world, we often associate computational problem-solving processes with the use of computers. Yet, solving problems computationally by designing solutions and processing data is not a digital skill, rather a mental skill. Humans have solved problems for eons and before anyone even thought about the types of digital technologies and devices we know today. The purpose of this article is to examine the historical route of computational thinking and how history can inspire and inform initiatives today. We introduce how computational thinking skills are rooted in non-digital (unplugged) human approaches to problem solving, and discuss how mainstream focus changed to digital (plugged) computer approaches, particularly on programming. In addition, we connect past research with current work in computer science education to argue that computational thinking skills and computing principles need to be taught in both unplugged and plugged ways for learners to develop deeper understanding of computational thinking ideas and their relevance in today’s society.

Therefore, we aimed to describe what preschool children’s CT experiences are like when button-operated robots are introduced into their guided play. This interpretive phenomenological study applied the Mosaic Approach to explore the emergence of CT skills during guided play with a button-operated robot (Bee-Bot).

JOUR ,,,,,"Quantitative population modelling is an invaluable tool for identifying the cascading effects of conservation on an ecosystem. When population data from monitoring programs is not available, deterministic ecosystem models have often been calibrated using the theoretical assumption that ecosystems have a stable, coexisting equilibrium. However, a growing body of literature suggests these theoretical assumptions are inappropriate for conservation contexts. Here, we develop an alternative for data-free population modelling that relies on expert-elicited knowledge of species populations. Our new Bayesian algorithm systematically removes model parameters that lead to impossible predictions, as defined by experts, without incurring excessive computational costs. We demonstrate our framework on an ordinary differential equation model by limiting predicted population sizes and their ability to change rapidly, utilising readily available knowledge from field observations and experts rather than relying on theoretical ecosystem properties. Our results show that using only coexistence and stability requirements can lead to unrealistic population dynamics, which can be avoided by switching to expert-derived information. We demonstrate how this change can dramatically impact population predictions, expected responses to management, conservation decision-making, and long-term ecosystem behaviour. Without data, we argue that field observations and expert knowledge are more trustworthy for representing ecosystems observed in nature, improving the precision and confidence in predictions.

JOUR ,,,,,"Insulators are essential components for protecting transmission lines, yet they are vulnerable to defects caused by harsh environments, which can compromise their performance and transmission stability. Regular inspections are therefore crucial. However, traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and pose safety risks when working under adverse conditions. In contrast, the combination of drone inspections and image processing technology enables the safe and efficient detection of insulator defects. In this study, the YOLOv8 model was used to detect insulators. Although YOLOv8 exhibits strong detection performance, it encounters challenges in terms of detection speed and computational efficiency in real-time tasks. To address these challenges, this study introduces EfficientViT from the Transformer framework to enhance feature extraction and improve the model’s computational efficiency. Additionally, a spatial context pyramid was incorporated into the model’s header module to bolster its feature analysis capabilities, particularly for small targets and intricate background details, yielding notable results. After several enhancements, the proposed network is named ES-YOLOv8s. The experimental results reveal that compared with YOLOv8, ES-YOLOv8s improved the precision, recall, mean average precision, and harmonic mean of the precision and recall scores on the Insulator Defect Image Dataset by 2%, 3%, 2.7%, and 3%, respectively.

JOUR ,,,,,"Scholars and practitioners are urgently highlighting the need to apply a relational approach to effectively address societal crises. At the same time, little is known about the associated challenges, and there is little advice regarding how to operationalize this approach in sustainability science. Against this background, this article explores how we can break out of our current paradigms and approaches, and instead apply relational thinking, being, and acting in the way we conduct research. To achieve this, we systematically list all major research phases, and assess possible pathways for integrating a relational paradigm for each step. We show that moving toward a relational paradigm requires us to methodically question and redefine existing theories of change, concepts, and approaches, for instance by combining abductive reasoning, first-person inquiries, and decentering the human through critical complexity theory. Challenging mainstream thought, and daring to ask different questions in each step is crucial to ultimately shift scientific norms and systems. Hence, we offer a catalog of questions that may help to systematically integrate relational being, thinking, and acting into the process, as a tool for transforming current paradigms in research, and associated education and practice. Finally, we highlight the importance of further research to develop and refine our outcomes.

JOUR ,,,,,"Low-light image enhancement methods based on deep learning have proven successful. In recent years, methods combining convolutional neural networks (CNN), multi-layer perceptron, and Retinex theory have achieved good results in enhancement tasks. The CNN has a limited receptive field, thus preventing it from modeling long-range pixel dependencies, and the Transformer is known for its capability to capture long-range dependencies but incurs significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive lightweight Transformer network (ALT-Net) to restore images under normal lighting conditions by simulating the reverse-sequential execution of image signal processor (ISP) pipelines. Specifically, in the reverse direction, we use a lightweight encoder–decoder to achieve inverse mapping and add adaptive modules for correction. In the sequential direction, we add noise reduction modules and attention mechanisms to query key parameters in the ISP pipeline (white balance and color correction, etc.) to adjust the image. Compared with Retinexformer, ALT-Net improves the PSNR and SSIM on the LOL-v2-real dataset by 0.11 dB and 0.002 respectively. With only 80 k parameters, our ALT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-light image enhancement tasks, and it is more cost-effective than similar methods.

JOUR ,,,,,"In recent times, there has been an increasing prevalence of surrogate models and metamodeling techniques in approximating the responses of complex systems. These surrogate models have proven to be effective in various engineering and scientific disciplines due to their ability to handle demanding computational requirements. The utilisation of surrogates can significantly reduce the time and resources required for calculations. However, practitioners and researchers in structural engineering face challenges in selecting the appropriate surrogate model due to the multitude of approaches available in surrogate modelling development. Despite the numerous advantages of surrogate models, their application in civil engineering has only been explored in the past few years. Consequently, there is a need for recommendations to guide practitioners in the proper utilisation of surrogate models. Additionally, comprehensive review studies are necessary to examine the current state-of-the-art in this area. Currently, there is a lack of research that investigates the implementation of surrogate models specifically in the context of structural engineering. Therefore, this article aims to address this gap by reviewing notable papers that have employed data-driven surrogate modelling in calculations within the field of structural engineering. To achieve this, a thorough analysis is conducted, encompassing a review of 91 journal articles published from 2003 onwards. The primary purpose of this analysis is to describe the various surrogate models employed, and to highlight the domains in which surrogates have been utilised so far. The study demonstrates that the utilisation of data-driven surrogate models in the field of structural engineering provides significant benefits owing to their flexible computational methods that produce accurate outcomes. However, there exist certain significant research gaps in the existing literature that need to be addressed in future studies.

JOUR ,,,,,"Cross-curricula opportunities afforded by STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education), supports an environment where students can develop twenty-first century competencies. One approach to addressing cross-curricula opportunities in STEM education is the introduction of computer science (computer programming—coding) as a basic skill/literacy for all students. Coding (computer programming) is a language that draws on a set of syntax rules (or blocks for primary school students) that informs a computer program to execute a series of functions. While there is evidence that computational thinking (the thinking used for coding/computer programming) and conceptual development in mathematics are connected, there is limited research related to how such a confluence applies to primary school students. The aim of this article is to provide insight into how mathematical knowledge and thinking, specifically the identification of mathematical patterns and structures, can be promoted through engagement with coding activities. The data for this article is drawn from year 2 students (n = 135) in two Australian primary schools. A teaching experiment approach was adopted for the study with a small intervention group (n = 40) undertaking coding lessons for 6 weeks. Data collection comprised of pre-test and post-tests with a focus on patterning and coding in conjunction with video-recorded lessons.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper reports on a design-based study within the context of a 3-day digital making (DM) summer camp attended by a group of students (aged 11–13) in grades 5 and 6. During the camp, students were presented with a set of mathematical problems to solve in a block-based programming environment, which was connected to various physical input sensors and output devices (e.g., push buttons, LED lights, number displays, etc.). Students’ code files, and screen captures of their computer work, were analyzed in terms of their developed computational problem-solving practices and any computational concepts that emerged during the problem-based DM. The results suggested that the designed tasks consistently supported the students’ modeling and algorithmic thinking, while also occasioning their testing and debugging practices; moreover, the students utilized computational abstractions in the form of variables, and employed different approaches, to formulate mathematical models in a programming context. This study contributes to the ‘big picture’ of how using computers might fundamentally change mathematics learning, with an emphasis on mathematical problem-solving. It also provides empirically grounded evidence to enhance the potential of computational thinking as a new literacy, and problem-solving as a global competence, in formal school settings.

JOUR ,,,,,"“They are the same” is a phrase that teachers often hear from their students in arithmetic and algebra. But what do students mean when they say this? The present paper researches the notion of sameness within algebraic thinking in the context of generating equivalent numerical equalities. A group of Grade 6 Mexican students (10- to 12-year-olds) was presented with tasks that required transforming the given numerical equalities in such a way as to show their truth-value. The students initially indicated this by calculating and demonstrating that the total was the same on both sides. When asked not to calculate, their approaches evolved into more structural transformations involving decomposition so as to arrive at an equality with the same expression on each side. Students used the language of sameness—both visible and invisible—to describe the truth-value of their transformed expressions and equalities. The visible sameness referred to the resulting identical form of each side of the equality and the invisible sameness to the top–down equivalences that they had generated by their decomposing transformations—both types of sameness being characterized by their hidden numerical values. These findings suggest implications for transitioning to the algebraic domain of equations with their similarly hidden values.

Further, we provide examples to demonstrate how the same seeds of algebraic thinking present in early childhood can be invoked in reasoning across contexts, grade levels, and different levels of formality of algebraic instruction.

Informed by Chevallard’s praxeology in terms of praxis and logos, we describe, unpack, discuss and expand these activities. Core issues related to algebra found in the three activities are as follows: making implicit variables explicit; using a counter variable; and identifying parameters as a specific type of variable. Our findings show that, in addition to already identified uses of variables in early algebra, programming activities in the early years bring in new aspects and new ways of treating variables that could, potentially, enhance students’ understanding of variables and generalization, provided that programming praxis is embedded in an appropriate algebra logos.

Students encounter persistent difficulties in dealing with these numbers, and we believe that these could be addressed through the development of algebraic thinking. We are particularly interested in relational thinking, a form of algebraic thinking involved in generalised arithmetic, characterised by the ability to identify the structure of an expression as well as the relationships between numbers. The idea of the ‘subtractive number’ has been highlighted in this context. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of relational thinking in dealing with negative numbers. We submitted a paper-and-pencil test to 166 grade 6 students in order to analyse their skills in operations with integers, as well as their relational thinking in questions relating to the compensation strategy in subtraction. We then examined the extent to which the students who answered the compensation questions correctly performed the operations with integers better than those who answered them incorrectly. Our results showed that students’ ability to see the subtraction operation as a ‘transformation’ involving a unary use of the minus sign appears to be a factor in their success in operations with negatives. Few students demonstrated this ability, yet it can be seen as an essential stage on which to base the progressive development of relational thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"Relational thinking and dealing with variables are two essential aspects of algebraic thinking. Relational thinking means viewing mathematical expressions and equations as a whole rather than as individual computing processes. It is characterized by using relationships between mathematical objects, and refers to the relations of equality and inequality. In this study, to examine the relational thinking of kindergarten and primary school children, this perspective was applied using non-symbolic representations in the form of boxes and marbles. Using multiple variables is a very powerful but also difficult tool of algebra. The study had the aim of examining how kindergarten children and primary school children establish relationships between several variables which are represented with real materials. The interview study was conducted with children aged 5–10 years. Marbles and different colored boxes represented equations with unknowns and quantities depending on each other. Initially, two approaches could be differentiated, namely, number-oriented and structure-oriented approaches. It could be shown that certain conceptualizations of variables were related to children’s ability to show relational thinking. Kindergarteners are stimulated to think relationally by unknown quantities which can be determined. This process was observed in primary school children dealing with quantities that depended on each other. In addition, the conceptualization of the variables represented as boxes was examined. The concepts of general number and variable as changing quantity were categorized. Further conceptualizations resulted from the interview data, namely, categories of the undeterminable, the specific number, and the quasi-general.

In a large-scale study, 470 primary students completed a written paper and pencil test. This included three reverse fraction tasks which required students to find an unknown whole when presented with a quantity representing a fraction of that whole. Seventeen students from one participating primary school undertook a semi-structured interview which included reverse fraction tasks, similar to those on the written test, but with progressive levels of abstraction, starting with particular instances and becoming more generalised. Two important products of the study are the Classification Framework for Reverse Fraction Tasks and the Emerging Algebraic Reasoning Framework. The interview results highlight two critical transition points for the emergence of students’ algebraic reasoning. The first is the ability to transition from additive strategies to multiplicative strategies to solve reverse fraction problems. Students reliant on diagrams and additive strategies struggled to solve more generalised tasks that required multiplicative rather than additive strategies. The second transition is the shift from multiplicative thinking to algebraic reasoning where students could generalise their multiplicative knowledge to deal with any quantity represented in a reverse fraction task.

In this paper, CT is seen as a boundary object connecting mathematics and computer science in a school problem-solving context. In particular, we examine and analyse middle school students’ work upon engaging in mathematical problem solving-in a programming environment, taking CT as a boundary object embedded in the block-based programming environment, Scratch. The analysis is guided by observing boundary crossing features of CT in the students’ artefacts produced in Scratch while solving mathematical problems related to symmetry and arithmetic sequence. The findings of this study open up new dimensions to explore CT as a boundary object in integrated STEM pedagogy.

JOUR ,,,,,"The act of making provides students with an opportunity to create and design by using materials and technologies. Scholars who examine learning through making maintain that maker approaches to solving problems, creating designs, and thinking about real-world ideas promote the development of abstract thinking skills, such as modeling, and computational thinking (CT) skills. Our goal is to research the use of specific methods of maker education—such as experimenting with tools and hands-on designs—in learning mathematics. We ask: what are the benefits and potential outcomes for designing and teaching learning activities which integrate technology maker practices and pedagogies in mathematics and other school concepts in STEM contexts? We analyzed qualitative data on the benefits and potential outcomes of maker practices and pedagogies from three cases in Canada and Brazil. The researchers designed and facilitated the tasks to study the experiences of participants. Participants were observed, interviewed (or asked interview questions via a questionnaire), and completed reflection prompts. Their activities were recorded. The results show that learning from maker practices and pedagogies augments the learning of individual STEM disciplines, with specific settings and activity designs offering varied foci on mathematics and technology, on science, engineering and mathematics, or on science, technology and mathematics. Students, preservice teachers and teachers benefit in cognitive, interdisciplinary and social (situated) ways. Further research is needed to explore how deeper and other benefits, including critical benefits, may be achieved for learning and teaching mathematics and to explore which practices and pedagogies are associated with more potential outcomes.

We present the research on each of these content clusters, and we discuss insights on effective teaching practices and the social processes supporting algebraic reasoning. The research base shows that incorporating algebraic thinking into the elementary grades, emphasizing analytic and structural thinking processes, and emphasizing covariational reasoning supports students’ meaningful learning of core algebraic ideas.

However, previous research has paid less attention to creative actions than to other learning outcomes, which are often product- instead of process-based, especially in a programming context. Thus, situated in the context of mathematical learning in a block-based programming environment, Scratch, this study seeks to investigate how in-service mathematics teachers develop mathematical concepts and programming skills to demonstrate their creative actions as a form of professional development. By conducting task-based interviews and thematic analysis, we found that testing and iterative practices of reusing and remixing are two important kinds of creative actions inspired by the programming environment, which give rise to new possibilities for doing mathematics in terms of generating new ways to engage in mathematical processes and to understand mathematics from a computational perspective. Our findings will inform teacher education and professional development programs addressing creativity in technology-enhanced mathematics classrooms, with particular attention to the role of mathematics, programming, and their interplay in inspiring teachers’ (and students’) creative actions and new possibilities for doing mathematics.

JOUR ,,,,,"This research, following a sequential mixed-methods design, delves into metacognitive control in problem solving among 5- to 6-year-olds, using two floor-robot environments. In an initial qualitative phase, 82 pupils participated in tasks in which they directed a floor robot to one of two targets, with the closer target requiring more cognitive effort due to the turns involved. The results of this phase revealed that younger students often rationalised their decisions based on reasons unrelated to the difficulty of the task, highlighting limitations in children’s language and abstract thinking skills and leading to the need for a second quantitative study. In this subsequent stage, involving 117 students, a computerised floor-robot simulator was used. The simulator executed the students’ planned movements and provided feedback on their validity. Each participant had three attempts per problem, with the option to change their target each time. The simulator stored the information pertaining to the chosen resolution path, design of the plan, and re-evaluation of decision making based on the results and feedback received. This study aims to describe the criteria upon which students base their metacognitive control processes in decision making within problem-solving programming tasks. Additionally, through a comparative analysis focusing on age and gender, this research aims to assess the relationship between metacognitive processes and success in problem-solving programming tasks.

We operationalize computational thinking as the ways of thinking that individuals employ when using computational tools to solve problems. Focusing on computational thinking in the context of data, we conceptualize three classes of data engagement (exploration, analysis, and communication) and review existing problem-solving phases and actions in the literature. In task-based interviews, we study statistics and data science undergraduate students, graduate students, and a professional data scientist using the R programming language to address a data exploration and analysis task. Using a grounded theory approach, we engaged in constant comparison to characterize segments from our interviews, with models from the literature building our theoretical sensitivity. Our results follow our participants’ data exploration and analysis across the problem-solving phases of orienting, planning, executing, and checking. In addressing our research question, we note the differences in how participants loaded the data, explored the data, and planned for the task at hand as well as the similarities in how participants constructed a derived object. We then propose an initial framework containing problem-solving actions, resources, and methods and heuristics, highlighting the interplay between data exploration and analysis (based on orienting to the data and orienting to the task, respectively) as well as the actions of recasting data and creating derived objects.

This special issue draws together new research in statistics education through a lens of data and ‘data-ing’. In much the same way as other statistical noun–verb pairings (such as sample–sampling and model–modelling), the terms data and data-ing exemplify both the forms and practices of engaging with contemporary data. Data have taken on unprecedented forms; the majority of which are unstructured, messy, massive, and rapidly or continuously collected. Data are in forms not previously even conceptualised, such as social media posts, satellite imagery, and tele-marketing recordings. To engage with these data requires making sense of, summarising, representing, and drawing conclusions from data, often without clear analytical approaches already developed. Hence, expanded skills for data literacy are needed for those who are not statistically trained to modify, combine, and invent techniques and ways of thinking to work with and make sense of data. There are important implications for education systems to rise to meet the challenges of educating learners to be competent, data literate citizens. This special issue contributes new knowledge from research of how students, teachers and citizens are learning to engage in new forms and practices with contemporary data. In this survey paper, we discuss research that uses these contemporary data and/or the subsequent tasks and pedagogies that have emerged to address these challenges, while questioning what this means for statistics education.

They should understand how the data generating process affects their conclusions and how to incorporate knowledge from subject matter experts in areas of application.

This work attends the need for a step-by-step guide and overall recommendations for the ADA design (including an evaluation rubric) that includes a mid-term ADA in the Mechanical Vibrations challenge based on the proposed guidelines. The ADA's implementation showed that the students developed competencies related to critical thinking, problem-solving, engineering design, and data analysis. The students proposed different solutions to the open-engineering problem while backing each assumption with relevant information and calculation. ADA offers the students the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to predict and discuss different scenarios in the challenge. The ADA-challenge design and implementation's results suggest that contextual argumentation with immersion is essential to promote a sense of purpose in the students. ADAs are essential tools that facilitate identifying and evaluating the development levels of various competencies while providing a forum for students to discuss, express, and apply acquired knowledge. ADAs can also improve the students' learning experience by providing continuous feedback in the context of conceptual and structural scaffolding. The ultimate goal is to give the students the relevant feedback that correctly identifies their achievements and monitors their progress and opportunity areas in their learning process.

The comprehensive computational investigations were conducted including density functional theories studies (DFTs), 2D-QSAR studies, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. The QSAR equation revealed that the activity of selected chromen-2-one-based piperidine derivatives is being affected by the six descriptors, i.e., Nitrogens Count, SdssCcount, SssOE-Index, T-2–2-7, ChiV6chain, and SssCH2E-Index. These descriptor values were further used for the preparation of chromen-2-one based piperidine derivatives. Based on this, 83 new derivatives were created from 7 selected parent compounds. The QSAR model predicted their IC50 values, with compound 4 k and 4kk as the most potent multi-targeted derivative. Molecular docking results exhibited these compounds as the best inhibitors; however, 4kk exhibited greater activity than the parent compounds. The results were further validated by molecular dynamic simulation studies along with the suitable physicochemical properties. These results prove to be an essential guide for the further design and development of new piperidine based chromen-2-one derivatives having better activity against neurodegenerative disorder.

JOUR ,,,,,"The late Professor Roddam Narasimha, widely recognized as a leading aerospace scientist and fluid dynamicist, had a keen interest in the history of Indic science, mathematics and philosophy, and made original contributions to these topics in the later part of his career. He was the proponent of the term ""computational positivism"", which, according to him, describes the epistemology of the classical Indic sciences that preferred algorithmic inference to axiomatic deduction favoured by ancient Greek philosophers. Narasimha conjectured that the Samkhya philosophy, one of the six orthodox philosophical systems of Indic origin, could have been inspirational in shaping the positivist attitude of the classical (and early modern) Indic science; he also brought out the similarity and differences between this philosophy and that of Francis Bacon, the 17th century British philosopher-statesman. The rational approach taken by the Samkhya school finds a connection with another ancient text, the Yoga Vasishta. Fascinated by this work, Narasimha produced original English translation of its selected verses on topics such as knowledge, consciousness, and reality. He was also interested in the history of technology in India and wrote about the development of rocketry deployed in the Anglo-Mysore wars of the 18th century.

Securing communication in a decentralized IoT network presents many challenges due to the abundance of devices and the dynamic nature of the network. For this purpose, A Decentralized lightweight group key management (DLGKM) system is proposed in this paper, that leverages fuzzy logic and Crossover boosted Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) named FLCPSO-KM to enhance decisions and settle disputes in IoT environments. DLGKM system uses fuzzy logic and CPSO in decision-making and dispute resolution, this allows for qualitative and quantitative optimization, leading to reliable outcomes. The system provides a lightweight and effective solution for secure communication in a decentralized IoT network.

JOUR ,,,,,"Economic evaluation is crucial for understanding the overall economic impact within data markets. It not only helps assess the growth and potential of the market but also informs strategic decisions for stakeholders. However, merchants’ concerns about data privacy remain a significant obstacle, especially when sensitive revenue data is involved. These data not only reflect the financial health of the merchants but could also be exploited by competitors, leading to potential adverse effects. Traditional economic evaluation methods often involve significant computational and communication overhead and cannot be scaled to a large number of merchants. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient and Private eConomic evAluation (EPCA) scheme. This scheme reduces computational and communication overhead while ensuring the privacy of individual merchant revenues. Specifically, EPCA uses two servers, and each merchant can securely submit their revenue data during the evaluation process. We leverage the Incremental Distributed Point Function (IDPF) to enable merchants to securely and privately share their revenue information without revealing it to any single entity. In addition, we use the public-key cryptosystem with distributed decryption to protect the privacy of market analysts’ inquiries. Correctness and security analysis demonstrate that EPCA can accurately evaluate the market size while protecting the privacy of merchant revenues. Experimental results show that EPCA is efficient and feasible for practical market size evaluation applications in data markets.

JOUR ,,,,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a relatively new idea that describes the interconnection of the web with many types of physical items through wired or wireless connections. As the information transmitted and received by these mobile hand-held devices travels via the air, it is vulnerable to eavesdropping, manipulation, and replay attacks. The computational requirements of security protocols and cryptographic algorithms used to offer authentication frameworks lead to an increase in power consumption. This study introduces RSAECI, a novel cryptographic algorithm designed to enhance security and efficiency for IoT applications. The RSAECI algorithm integrates the principles of traditional RSA with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to achieve a balance between strong encryption and reduced computational overhead. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, the study compares RSAECI with traditional RSA and ECC across various performance metrics, including security strength, computational overhead, communication overhead, energy consumption, and encryption/decryption time. The results demonstrate that RSAECI offers significant improvement in efficiency, with a 57% reduction in computational overhead, a 59% decrease in communication overhead, and a 25% reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional RSA. These enhancements are particularly beneficial for resource-constrained IoT environments, where efficiency and security are paramount.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper is ambitious: it begins with mixing externalism in philosophy of mind with internalism in epistemology, and it ends with instructive insights from social and feminist thought. In the first stage, I argue that one can consistently combine two theses that appear, at first glance, incompatible: cognitive externalism—the thesis that one’s mental states/processing can extend past one’s biological boundaries—and mentalism in epistemology—i.e., that epistemic justification supervenes on one’s mental states. This yields the perhaps startling or strange view that the loci of epistemic justification are both mental states and (can be) located externally to one’s skull and skin. This motivates the second stage: I aim to ease that strangeness by suggesting that most discussions of cognitive externalism and epistemology too often focus exclusively on extending epistemically reliable abilities, faculties, dispositions, etc. to artifacts (e.g., notebooks, computers) in one’s environment. Instead, we should think of this combination as informed by feminist epistemologists’ insistence of our thinking’s irreducible and radical sociality. Epistemic communities shape and are shaped by our cognition—echoing the dynamic, interactive integration at the heart of cognitive externalism. Thus, just as I am part of an epistemic community, it is also a part of me (literally). Thus, I think with others: not merely as an artifact but as constituent elements of my cognition itself; resulting in a robust socially extended internalism. ",,,"McCraw, Benjamin W.

In the tool, coding ability was evaluated on the dimensions of Variable, Control, Modularity, and Algorithm. The first three dimensions of the tool included the skills of Assignment, Type, Conditional, Loop, Decomposition, and Function. We tested the psychometric properties of the tool by assessing its reliability and validity. The results indicated that the tool not only had good internal consistency, inter-raters reliability, and test-retest reliability, but also showed good content validity, construct validity, and item discrimination. Additionally, the coding ability measured by the tool was significantly related to creative thinking and computational thinking, suggesting good criterion validity. To conclude, this study developed an age-appropriate and game-based tool with good psychometric properties to assess the coding ability of young children. This tool can be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of educational coding programs for young children.

JOUR ,,,,,"To advance the understanding of the environment-human relation, the present research examined individuals’ emotional variability, which captures the fluctuation in negative and positive emotional states across environments. Specifically, we examined the relationship between holistic thinking and emotional variability across environments in three studies. Study 1 found that stronger holistic thinking was associated with greater emotional variability across natural environments, and this relationship was explained by stronger connectedness to nature. Study 2 replicated this pattern by including environments with more diverse characteristics as the stimuli. Study 3 further explored the potential moderating effect of the type of environment and the cultural background. The data of Chinese and American participants showed that the relationships of holistic thinking, connectedness to environments, and emotional variability across environments were more evident among Chinese participants while the type of environment had minimal impact. Implications for cross-culture environmental research were discussed.

Thus, this study sought to compare the types of errors made by the low-performing students from different school types in solving word problems involving higher-order thinking skills by conducting a multiple case study. The study involved 18 low-performing students from a National Primary School (NPS), National-Type Chinese Primary School (NTCPS), and National-Type Tamil Primary School (NTTPS) in Malaysia. The students’ errors in solving eight word problems were identified qualitatively through conducting four sessions of diagnostic interviews, followed by the Newman’s Error Analysis. Then, a cross-case analysis was conducted. The findings indicated that the participants of the three school types made reading, comprehension, transformation, process skills and encoding errors. However, the NPS and NTTPS low-performing students made more process skills errors and encoding errors, as compared to the NTCPS low-performing students. The findings imply the need to enhance the procedural fluency of NPS and NTTPS low-performing students for reducing the achievement gaps among the school types.

JOUR ,,,,,"In populations from sub-Saharan African countries, depression is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Depressive symptoms are particularly prevalent and heterogeneous among young adults. In this study conducted among Nigerian young adults, we used computational network approaches to disclose the most central depressive symptoms and the probabilistic dependencies among them. Precisely, two distinct computational network approaches were used: a Gaussian graphical model (i.e., undirected, GGM) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Participants (N = 502, Mage = 22.10, range: 17–40 years) completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale–Revised, which accords with the DSM-5 criteria for major depression disorder. Within the GGM, depressed mood emerged as the most central symptom, followed by sleep disturbance, fatigue, anhedonia, and feelings of worthlessness as indexed by Expected Influence values. The strongest edge was between anhedonia and feelings of worthlessness. In the DAG, anhedonia topped the model and directly activated depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, fatigue and sleep disturbance. These findings from both computational network approaches offer novel data-driven insights on the set of the core symptoms constitutive of depression network among Nigerian young adults. Findings confirm the existing depression network literature. For solid clinical utility, future network research using both clinical and non-clinical samples from sub-Saharan Africa may constitute an important step forward to consolidating the present study’s findings.

JOUR ,,,,,"The Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) has been validated across various European countries. However, in China, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the factor structure and psychometric properties of teachers’ digital competency scales. This study aims to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of DigCompEdu among Chinese primary and secondary school teachers. A convenience sample of 412 primary and secondary school teachers was surveyed with three distinct scales: DigCompEdu, attitudes towards the utilization of digital tools, and the computational thinking scale. Employing confirmatory factor analyses and Bayesian structural equation modeling, we determined that the high-order factor model of the Chinese adaptation of DigCompEdu exhibited a robust fit. The construct encompasses a high-order factor termed “general digital competence”, accompanied by six distinct dimensions: Professional Engagement, Digital Resources, Teaching and Learning, Assessment, Empowering Learners, and Facilitating Learners’ Digital Competence. Significant positive correlations emerged between general digital competence, the six dimensions, and attitudes towards digital technology use, as well as computational thinking (r = 0.299 ~ 0.904, all ps < 0 0.001). Teachers who frequently employed digital tools demonstrated markedly higher levels of digital competence across all dimensions compared to those who utilized fewer than five digital tools. Notably, urban educators scored significantly higher than their rural counterparts across all factors of DigCompEdu. Composite reliabilities ranged from 0.787 to 0.972, while homogeneity reliability stood at 0.918. The factor structure of DigCompEdu is applicable to the Chinese teacher sample. Based on the findings from the high-order factor model analysis, we propose that it would be valuable to include the total score of the scale alongside the scores for each individual dimension.

This study aims to demonstrate the significance of incorporating environmental themes into art education curricula and its impact on students' environmental consciousness and artistic innovation in China. To achieve this, the study employed a mixed-method research approach, gathering insights from 96 art design educators and 295 college students through quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. The findings underscored that integrating natural materials into art design enhances students' creativity and supports a deeper appreciation for environmental management. Environmental art and design were found to be effective tools for raising awareness about environmental pollution and advocating for conservation efforts. This research highlights the multifaceted benefits of environmental art design, including its potential to enhance students' artistic proficiency, personal development, and overall well-being. The study's findings offer practical implications for both educators and policymakers, suggesting the integration of environmental art design into educational curricula. By incorporating environmental art, schools can cultivate critical thinking skills, implant a sense of environmental responsibility, and inspire creative solutions to environmental challenges, ultimately producing environmentally conscious individuals capable of addressing ecological issues effectively.

JOUR ,,,,,"When foraging for food, animals must balance levels of exploitation and exploration. Too much exploitation leads to an exhaustion of the source and means one will never know if there are better sources of food elsewhere. Too much exploration and one will never reap the benefits from a source. Recently, substantial evidence has implicated this tradeoff in human sequential decision-making, such as when choosing which restaurant to dine at. Computational models of optimal foraging have been used to describe both foraging and sequential decision-making, suggesting a common substrate. Importantly, these models factor in the opportunity cost of (travel) time by assuming perfect temporal cognition. Here, we apply a recently proposed intertemporal choice model that mixes rate distortion theory and hyperbolic discounting to estimate people’s expected opportunity cost of time. Assuming that the adaptive control of temporal cognition is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation, we hypothesized that model parameters would be able to predict childhood adversity, as the type of environment one was raised in has been shown to explain differences in explore-exploit behavior.

JOUR ,,,,,"Traditional dialectics based on the “thesis-antithesis-synthesis” model falls short in addressing complex scientific problems devoid of clear opposition/antagonism. A more effective approach is essential for these intricate problems. This paper introduces a novel dialectical method—centralized dialectics—based on “analysis-synthesis” for addressing complex phenomena that lack clear antagonistic features and are governed by parsimonious underlying mechanisms. When applied to neuroscience, this method is referred to as “dialectic neuroscience.” The proposed method mirrors Bayesian model selection, guided by criteria rationality, comprehensive accountability, and parsimony. Analytical components interact through synthesis, analogous to identifying the central missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle (with the peripheral pieces representing analytic facts), hence the term “centralized.” The output is the theory or mechanism derived from this synthesis process through nonlinear or creative thinking. Centralized dialectics principles have been implicitly utilized across various disciplines, particularly in modern physics, yet remain unarticulated. Major depressive disorder (MDD) serves as a demonstration of dialectic neuroscience, wherein the approach successfully identified an abnormal reciprocal suppressive network mechanism associated with MDD, which was later empirically validated. From an engineering perspective, synthetic results correspond to achieving local or global optima. Centralized dialectics provides a rigorous, flexible, and interdisciplinary framework for complex problem-solving. It has the potential to reshape scientific standards, foster creative thinking, and enable cross-validation across diverse fields. This method could help frame non-linear thinking and creativity within a scientific framework. A structured formulation is recommended to ensure synthesis quality and to facilitate mutual verification among different parties. This metascience research employed a systematic and integrative approach, beginning with an extensive literature review to identify limitations in existing dialectical methods and establish the foundation for centralized dialectics. Conceptual modeling and a Bayesian framework were then utilized to formalize the proposed framework, followed by exemplifying its application across diverse disciplines. To illustrate, the author analyzed MDD through the lens of centralized dialectics, proposed a theory, and provided empirical validation. Both the essence of centralized dialectics and its strategic implementation are emphasized. The potential of centralized dialectics to complement current scientific standards by incorporating creative and nonlinear thinking into scientific activities without sacrificing meticulousness is highlighted.

JOUR ,,,,,"Despite its obvious advantages, the disruptive development of neurotechnology can pose risks to fundamental freedoms. In the context of such concerns, proposals have emerged in recent years either to design human rights de novo or to update the existing ones. These new rights in the age of neurotechnology are now widely referred to as “neurorights.” In parallel, there is a considerable amount of ongoing academic work related to updating the right to freedom of thought in order to include the protection of “freedom of thinking” (i.e., freedom of thought itself) and not only its social manifestations. Neurorights such as cognitive liberty, free will, mental freedom, and mental self-determination come into play here. Importantly, freedom of thought has often been considered a prerequisite for all the other fundamental freedoms and rights. In any case, just as other rights require additional legal instruments to guarantee their compliance, substantial neurorights will probably require specific complementary developments in procedural law. In relation to this, there is a long tradition of habeas corpus as an emergency remedy to enforce the rights of a citizen against illegal or arbitrary detention. More recently, the habeas data writ has been proposed and admitted in certain countries to guarantee a person’s ownership of their personal data. In this article, we propose to expand this procedural apparatus by incorporating a third habeas, which we call habeas cogitationem: a writ aimed primarily at enforcing the right to freedom of thinking (and, subsidiarily, the rest of neurorights) against direct, harmful interferences in a person’s thought process by both public and private perpetrators.

JOUR ,,,,,"Much leading thought about consciousness in the inter-war period was associated with the British intellectual C. K. Ogden. His International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method included landmark textbooks by major psychologists including Adler, Jung, Koffka, and Piaget. His journal Psyche, included work about Behaviorism, brain chemistry, and essays such as ‘Are we becoming more conscious?’ by literary critic I. A. Richards. The chapter surveys the work from Ogden’s projects which demonstrates the greatest acuity and foresight about questions concerning consciousness which preoccupy us now. It concentrates on Ogden’s other book series – especially To-Day and To-Morrow. Some of the more provocative new thinking about consciousness is to be found among its speculations on the future. In one of the pioneering transhumanist texts in this series, J. D. Bernal’s The World, the Flesh and the Devil invents the electronic cyborg. He imagines increasing longevity by transferring brains to machine hosts; hot-wiring them to instruments providing extra senses – X-ray, chemistry, but above all radio. This would enable them to be in direct wireless contact with everyone else – effectively the internet before the invention of the computer. Such interconnectivity makes imaginable a form of collective consciousness. Such ideas mesh with new thinking about language and criticism; fields in which Ogden and Richards were also pioneers. These writers poised before the threshold of computing thus raise questions which anticipate work in subsequent neuroscience, and also our moment at the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, and the questions that raises about whether consciousness can be extended, synthesized, or indeed detected.

JOUR ,,,,,"Driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and anthropomorphic robotic systems, the various possibilities and risks of such technologies have become a topic of urgent discussion. Although science fiction (SF) works are often cited as references for visions of future developments, this framework of discourse may not be appropriate for serious discussions owing to technical inaccuracies resulting from its reliance on entertainment media. However, these science fiction works could help researchers understand how people might react to new AI and robotic systems. Hence, classifying depictions of artificial intelligence in science fiction may be expected to help researchers to communicate more clearly by identifying science fiction elements to which their works may be similar or dissimilar. In this study, we analyzed depictions of artificial intelligence in SF together with expert critics and writers. First, 115 AI systems described in SF were selected based on three criteria, including diversity of intelligence, social aspects, and extension of human intelligence. Nine elements representing their characteristics were analyzed using clustering and principal component analysis. The results suggest the prevalence of four distinctive categories, including human-like characters, intelligent machines, helpers such as vehicles and equipment, and infrastructure, which may be mapped to a two-dimensional space with axes representing intelligence and humanity.

Although the feel-good factor in the team process was investigated, no significant impact was found. Under the team environment theme, we compared different opinions on the orientation (e.g., scripted roles) and the use of technology (e.g., integrated development environment tools). Future research should investigate how task structure influences team effectiveness of DPP and relates to computational thinking education. Additionally, because most studies were conducted in higher education contexts, more research in primary and secondary educational contexts is also needed.

JOUR ,,,,,"To meet the demands of 21st-century societies and economies, faculty across disciplines must engage college and university students with course activities and assignments that foster the development of computational thinking (CT) skills. Toward this end, examining the ways in which CT can be infused into general education courses has been a topic of recent research. However, the question remains about how students in non-computer science courses can use CT skills in course assignments across disciplines. Guided by a rubric aimed to evaluate the development of CT skills including decomposition, algorithms, data, and abstraction, we examined 101 student-generated artifacts in undergraduate courses across four disciplines: mathematics, sociology, music, and English. In this work, we report on assignment prompts and overall CT skills exhibited by participating students. While some disciplines may not fully facilitate the development of all CT skills, a range of these skills was reflected in student artifacts. We present representative examples demonstrating CT skill development across various levels, including capstone level (score 4), milestone (score 3), benchmark (score 1), and no usage (score 0). The findings of this work provide insights into ways in which higher education faculty can design assignment prompts that support and scaffold students’ development of CT skills, as well as how students across disciplines respond to CT prompts. Findings also have implications for the design of CT-related assessment instruments.

JOUR ,,,,,"Artificial intelligence has not achieved defining features of biological intelligence despite models boasting more parameters than neurons in the human brain. In this perspective article, we synthesize historical approaches to understanding intelligent systems and argue that methodological and epistemic biases in these fields can be resolved by shifting away from cognitivist brain-as-computer theories and recognizing that brains exist within large, interdependent living systems. Integrating the dynamical systems view of cognition with the massive distributed feedback of perceptual control theory highlights a theoretical gap in our understanding of nonreductive neural mechanisms. Cell assemblies—properly conceived as reentrant dynamical flows and not merely as identified groups of neurons—may fill that gap by providing a minimal supraneuronal level of organization that establishes a neurodynamical base layer for computation. By considering information streams from physical embodiment and situational embedding, we discuss this computational base layer in terms of conserved oscillatory and structural properties of cortical-hippocampal networks. Our synthesis of embodied cognition, based in dynamical systems and perceptual control, aims to bypass the neurosymbolic stalemates that have arisen in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience.

JOUR ,,,,,"First concepts of cortex-basal ganglia interactions suggested that cognitive functions are implemented through different parallel, segregated cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loops. Recent evidence however shows that there are at least 4 ways by which different loops could interact: overlapping cortico-pallidal projections, overlapping cortico-striatal projections, striato-nigro-striatal spirals, and cortico-thalamo-striatal projections. We propose that current evidence, if incorporated into neuro-computational models, provides new avenues for explaining cognitive functions. Using a recently introduced hierarchical neuro-computational model of multiple cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loops, we exemplify how interaction between loops can explain behavioral data linked to the ideomotor theory. During training of a stimulus–response task, a task-irrelevant tone is played after each action. Then, during a test period, the same tones are played but together with the stimuli. The model learns a distributed representation of action outcomes which is then used to select actions. Similar to observations in human subjects, the model’s response time is larger if an inconsistent tone (previously listened together with an alternative action) is played with the stimulus. Understanding the function of different communication strategies between loops could be the key to fully unravel the neural basis of the numerous functions supported by the basal ganglia. The multiple-loop structure allows for a more complex representation of behavior in which action outcomes are considered. ",,,"Hamker, Fred H.

JOUR ,,,,,"Phenomenology is concerned with the first-person experience of or about some object, and is generally related to sensory experience, for example, auditory or visual. Cognitive phenomenology refers to an element of phenomenological experience that does not have a sensory character. Experiences of thought, understanding, and appreciation of meaning are less figurative than the sensory kind and therefore suggest a treatment separate from that related to sensory experience. Where sensory phenomenology is discussed as there being something, it is like to be in a sensory state (of color or some object like a banana), and it is less evident that there is something it is like to think, understand, or recognize meaning. As Strawson [1] puts it: “It’s strange that the existence of cognitive phenomenology is a matter of dispute.” But dispute there is, this paper examines this The Nature of Cognitive Phenomenology and Its Denial and suggests instances from neurology and logical argumentation that CP does exist. In this paper, while the existence phenomenal consciousness is a matter of philosophical debate, the CP of understanding is seen as important to those who work on language understanding in a computational domain. The salient method is a critical examination and comparison of relevant literature in different disciplines. Specifically, one instance of cognitive phenomenology is addressed: the understanding experience. However, the very existence of cognitive phenomenology is a controversial issue in philosophical discourse. Accordingly, in addition to a presentation of cognitive phenomenology, the controversy over its necessity as a concept is examined: a study dismissing CP is presented, and an example (a phenomenal contrast argument) is introduced. New arguments based on formal examples of “understanding” are proposed to further corroborate the existence of CP. Then, in the light of existing work on event-related potentials that measure changes in brain activity patterns under linguistic input, a neural support for cognitive phenomenology is elicited as an additional proof of its existence. The key result is that arguments from neurology and linguistics provide support for the existence of at least one facet of cognitive phenomenology (understanding) with the possibility that such presence could be measurable and extended to other modes. The arguments presented in the paper provide a grounding for using the CP concept in computing, as a complement to synthetic phenomenology.

JOUR ,,,,,"The flexibility, adaptability, and resilience of even simple brains are unmatched by any current technology. Recent unexpected difficulties in realising truly autonomous vehicles, making reliable medical diagnoses, detecting offensive online content and even just recognising faces, show that brains remain significantly functionally more capable than we can currently emulate. Fittingly, in recent years we have made significant progress identifying computational principles that underlie neural function. We are beginning to dispense with the overly simplistic stimulus-driven encode/transmit/decode doctrine. Instead we must embrace the brain’s inherent dynamic complexity and emergent properties and explain how plasticity moulds the dynamics to capture useful couplings across brain regions and between the brain, the body, and the world. While certainly not complete, we have sufficient evidence that a synthesis of these ideas could result in a deeper understanding of neural computation and which could potentially be used to construct new AI technologies with unique capabilities. I discuss the relevant neuroscientific principles, the advantages they have for computation, and how they can benefit AI. Limitations of current AI are now generally recognised.

However, there is a lack of research on the cognitive behaviors and cognitive styles promoted by these educational board games. Therefore, in this study, educational board games are adopted as a tool to explore the learning effectiveness and behavioral patterns of students with different cognitive styles. A total of 74 students participated in this study, and the educational board game used was a set of coding poker cards. The results showed that educational board games contribute to students’ computational thinking skills, especially regarding operators. For students with different cognitive styles, holist-style students experience greater learning effectiveness when using educational board games than serialist-style students. In addition, it is found that students need to analyze the choices and arrangements of cards while playing educational board games, which improves their thinking in terms of problem solving. Furthermore, through cognitive behaviors, students can use the concepts of computational thinking skills and then achieve the learning goals of computational thinking skills.

JOUR ,,,,,"A density functional theory study was performed to design new N-heterocyclic silyl pincer fullerenes based on the reactions of diaminofullerene with chlorosilanes SiHRCl2. Reaction energies of the formation of pincer fullerene ligands increased through the substitution of flanking arms with CH3 and phenyl groups. However, substituting hydrogen of SiH2 with methyl slightly increased the corresponding reaction energies; replacing hydrogen with phenyl group decreased the reaction energies of the considered pincer fullerenes. While the calculated electrophilicity values of the pincer fullerenes are larger than the electrophilicity values obtained for the fullerene derivatives, the substitution of hydrogen atoms of central SiH2 and PH2 did not has a noticeable impact on the electrophilicity values of the pincer fullerenes. The only exception was SiHPh(NCH2PH2)2C60. Natural bonding orbital analysis showed that the delocalization of electrons from the lone pairs of phosphorous atoms to the n* orbital of transition metal atoms was a key factor for stabilizing the considered complexes. The strongest interaction was due to the delocalization of electrons from lone pairs of phosphorous atoms in the flanking arms to the LP* of transition metals, which was followed by the delocalization of electrons of the Si-H σ* orbitals to the LP* of transition metals.

The third section reviews the generative modelling framework. The final section presents our approach in detail. We conclude by discussing how our approach differs from previous attempts to use generative modelling to help understand consciousness. In summary, we describe a version of computational phenomenology which uses generative modelling to construct a computational model of the inferential or interpretive processes that best explain this or that kind of lived experience.

JOUR ,,,,,"It is widely acknowledged that interdisciplinarity (ID) is very diverse. Our contribution is a demonstration that considerable diversity exists also on the level of understandings of ID that researchers working in the same ID field express. Specifically, we analyse qualitatively, building on the method of culture contrast, six interviews with researchers working in computational linguistics and language technology in Estonia. We identify six understandings of ID expressed by the interviewees: centred on an ID method; a disciplinary method in an ID field; an ID way of seeing and thinking; ID education; ID interests; one’s field as naturally ID. We show how understandings of ID are significant for analysing research practice, since they are involved in how researchers form a positive picture of themselves and their colleagues. We also show how an awareness of different understandings of ID is useful for discussing the significance of integration in ID.

JOUR ,,,,,"Scientists, either working alone or in groups, require rich cognitive, social, cultural, and material environments to accomplish their epistemic aims. There is research in the cognitive sciences that examines intelligent behavior as a function of the environment (“environmental perspectives”), which can be used to examine how scientists integrate “cognitive-cultural” resources as they create environments for problem-solving. In this paper, I advance the position that an expanded framework of distributed cognition can provide conceptual, analytical, and methodological tools to investigate how scientists enhance natural cognitive capacities by creating specific kinds of environments to address their epistemic goals. In a case study of a pioneering neuroengineering lab seeking to understand learning in living networks of neurons, I examine how the researchers integrated conceptual, methodological, and material resources from engineering, neuroscience, and computational science to create different kinds of distributed problem-solving environments that enhanced their natural cognitive capacities, for instance, for reasoning, visualization, abstraction, imagination, and memory, to attain their epistemic aims.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper describes an artificial intelligence (AI) educational project conducted with a small number of 12-year-old students. It is a preliminary step to add AI learning in a city-wide program consisting of elementary school students who learn computational thinking and digital literacy. Today children grow up in an age of AI which significantly affects how we live, work, and solve problems therefore AI should be taught in schools. Children usually employ AI models as black boxes without understanding the computational concepts, underlying assumptions, nor limitations of AI models. The hypothesis of this study is that to understand how machines learn, students should actively construct a neural network. To address this issue a dedicated curriculum and appropriate scaffolds were created for this study. It includes a programmable learning environment for elementary school students to construct AI agents. Findings show high engagement during the constructionist learning and that the novel learning environment helped make machine learning understandable.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) is often regarded as providing a ‘soft start’ for later involvement with artificial intelligence and, hence, as a crucial twenty-first century skill. The introduction of CT in primary mathematics curricula puts many demands on teachers, and their understanding of CT in mathematics is key to its successful introduction. Inspired by an information ecology perspective, we investigate how four primary school teachers understand CT in mathematics and how they go ahead to include CT in their mathematics teaching practice. Through observations and interviews, we find promising starting points for including CT, related to pattern recognition, problem solving and the use of programming activities. Our findings indicate that teachers’ lack of knowledge affects CT adoption in two ways: during its inclusion in the existing mathematics curriculum and as a new element focussed on programming and coding, leaving mathematics in the background. For the inclusion to be fruitful, we suggest there is a need to help teachers understand how CT can be used productively in mathematics and vice versa.

JOUR ,,,,,"Learning is central to both artificial intelligence and human intelligence, the former focused on understanding how machines learn, the latter concerned with how humans learn. With the growing relevance of computational thinking, these two efforts have become more closely connected. This survey examines these connections and points to the need for educating the general public to understand the challenges which the increasing integration of AI in human lives pose. We describe three different framings of computational thinking: cognitive, situated, and critical. Each framing offers valuable, but different insights into what computational thinking can and should be. The differences between the three framings also concern the views of learning that they embody. We combine the three framings into one framework which emphasizes that (1) computational thinking activities involve engagement with algorithmic processes, and (2) the mere use of a digital artifact for an activity is not sufficient to count as computational thinking. We further present a set of approaches to learning computational thinking. We argue for the significance of computational thinking as regards artificial intelligence on three counts: (i) Human developers use computational thinking to create and develop artificial intelligence systems, (ii) understanding how humans learn can enrich artificial intelligence systems, and (iii) such enriched systems will be explainable.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper presents a case study of in situ activities in two Danish preschools. In the activities, learning computational thinking (CT) plays a central part. The participating 4- to 5-year-old children are invited by an external educator to employ tangibles, such as robots, for structured problem-solving tasks within an overall narrative framing. In accordance with elaborations on CT as a problem-solving strategy, it is examined how the children engage in CT as problem-solving. The activities are part of a municipal initiative that involves preschools in a larger Danish city. The aim of this municipal initiative is to support young children’s understanding of technologies, coding and robotics as an element of twenty-first century skills. Based on video observations, the study provides a situated account of how the children engage in problem-solving in the observed activities. In empirical terms, the study shows how problem-solving tasks, such as programming a robot to move from A to B, merge with complex endeavors of engaging meaningfully with things and people in social situations. These empirical findings are analyzed by employing theoretical conceptualizations of problem-solving from a sociocultural perspective. This leads to a critical discussion regarding the relevance, potentials and pitfalls of introducing CT through problem-solving tasks with tangible tools in Danish preschool settings.

JOUR ,,,,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday interactions with pervasive digital systems. This development increasingly calls for citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9 education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is particularly important when novices from both both early and higher education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing, and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum. The central discussion raised by the paper, is the nature of the integration between mathematics and PCT in these tasks. These resources provide opportunities for discussion of how we may better integrate PCT and mathematics from the perspective of both subjects to build a solid foundation for a critical understanding of AI interactions in future generations.

Pace gently the denotation of technopoiesis as a juvenile phase of technological development and the “ontological measurements” as logical and practical impossibility in the modern, mathematized metroscape, the paper reexamines the relevancy of the distinctions (ontic/ontological and po[i]etic/practical, both recalling Heidegger’s “hermeneutical” critique of Husserl’s phenomenology) in non-Platonic/Aristotelian contexts and, in the process, seeks to refine the vital notion of technopoiesis by looking at the intersection of these fuzzy domains. In particular, the ancient Chinese measurements and their understudied onto-poietic dimension in the shifting econ-political contexts may offer an alternative approach to the otherwise elusive presence of technopoiesis and its ontological roots. Arguing that the techno-onto-poiesis does not necessarily belong to the foregone Arcadian past, the paper proposes refined “signals” for recognizing the technopoietic as well as new “forms” of its presence—“interactive emergence” (the cross-stimulating agonistic interactions between techniques of different “stages”) and “poietic clusters” (poietic ideas and/or implements that survive as “cluster” into the future), calling for future investigation of technical inventiveness (even in modern times) that reveal the process of how technopoietic elements enter the lives of technology through least expected embodiment.

JOUR ,,,,,"According to virtue epistemology, the main aim of education is the development of the cognitive character of students (Pritchard, 2014, 2016). Given the proliferation of technological tools such as ChatGPT and other LLMs for solving cognitive tasks, how should educational practices incorporate the use of such tools without undermining the cognitive character of students? Pritchard (2014, 2016) argues that it is possible to properly solve this ‘technology-education tension’ (TET) by combining the virtue epistemology framework with the theory of extended cognition (EXT) (Clark and Chalmers, 1998). He argues that EXT enables us to consider tools as constitutive parts of the students’ cognitive system, thus preserving their cognitive character from technologically induced cognitive diminishment. The first aim of this paper is to show that this solution is not sufficient to solve the TET. Second, I aim to offer a complementary and more encompassing framework of tool-use to address the TET. Then, I apply it to the educational uses of ChatGPT as the most notable example of LLM, although my arguments can be extended to other generative AI systems. To do so, in Sect. 1.1, I present Pritchard’s framework of cognitive character and virtue epistemology applied in education, to which I am committed in this treatment. In Sects. 2 and 3, I respectively illustrate Pritchard’s (2014) solution to the TET, and I highlight the general limitations of his proposal. Thus, in Sect. 4.1 I characterize ChatGPT as a computational cognitive artifact using Fasoli’s (Fasoli, 2017, 2018) taxonomy of cognitive artifacts. In Sect. 4.2, I introduce my proposal, which combines Pritchard’s account of virtue epistemology with Fasoli’s (2017, 2018) taxonomy of cognitive artifacts to address the TET. Finally, in Sect. 5.1, I present some epistemically virtuous uses of ChatGPT in educational contexts.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper is about the opposite of judgement and calculation. This opposition has been a traditional anchor of critiques concerned with the rise of AI decision making over human judgement. Contrary to these approaches, it is argued that human judgement is not and cannot be replaced by calculation, but that it is human judgement that contextualises computational structures and gives them meaning and purpose. The article focuses on the epistemic structure of algorithms and artificial neural networks to find that they always depend on human judgement to be related to real life objects or purposes. By introducing the philosophical concept of judgement, it becomes clear that the property of judgement to provide meaning and purposiveness is based on the temporality of human life and the ambiguity of language, which quantitative processes lack. A juxtaposition shows that calculations and clustering can be used and referred to in more or less prejudiced and reflecting as well as opaque and transparent ways, but thereby always depend on human judgement. The paper clearly asserts that the transparency of AI is necessary for their autonomous use. This transparency requires the explicitness of the judgements that constitute these computational structures, thereby creating an awareness of the conditionality of such epistemic entities.

JOUR ,,,,,"Machine learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence (AI), is a fascinating technology and can be considered as the closest approximation to the Cartesian “thinking thing” that humans have ever created. Just as the industrial revolution required a new ethos, the age of intelligent machines will create its own, challenging the established moral, economic, and political presuppositions. This paper discusses the relationship between AI and society; it presents several thought experiments to explore the complexity of the relationship and highlights the insufficiency of the current normative paradigm in addressing technological expansion. I argue that many of the externalities, such as security risks, loss of privacy, and economic instability  will result from trying to fit the emerging technologies into the existing frame of efficiency and utility, by redefining the notions of human value, identity, autonomy, purity, and truth, among others. The age of the intelligent machine is elevating alienation to new levels, treating the individual as mere patterns in data—its primary commodity. I further argue that while the possibility of unintended consequences, due to the potential misuse of AI is ever present, the intelligent machine per se is unlikely to engage in a zero-sum game for power on its own initiative. I question whether singularity is at all attainable and argue that technology will forever remain a proxy for human interests. I conclude by posing questions for charting the path forward.

JOUR ,,,,,"This work focuses on feature selection in Arabic sentiment analysis (ASA) via a swarm-based approach. The importance of swarm intelligence methods comes from their optimization ability and implementation simplicity. The novel algorithm rat swarm optimization (RSO) proves its superiority in both exploitation and exploration capabilities allowing it to achieve good optimization results. A binary version of RSO (BRSO) is applied for the first time in this context. Despite the significant results achieved by BRSO, and like most optimization algorithms, it can entrap in the local optimum and slow convergence problems. A modified binary rat swarm optimization (M-BRSO) algorithm is proposed to overcome these limitations. On the one hand, the M-BRSO algorithm uses the opposite-based learning strategy in the initialization phase to improve the convergence rate of the population. On the other hand, the private thinking mechanism is enhanced by replacing the current rat’s position with its personal best (Pbest) found so far to prevent it from trapping in the local optimum. Four criteria were adopted to measure the performance of the proposed algorithms: fitness value, classification accuracy, percentage of selected features, and elapsed time. The application of the proposed algorithms on different benchmark datasets for ASA gives promising results regarding reducing the feature space with important accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art swarm-based algorithms.

JOUR ,,,,,"Coding and computational thinking are being hailed as the new literacy for the twenty-first century, and have become increasingly common in schools world-wide. At the same time, the sector is facing a global shortage of technology teachers, and technology lessons are frequently being delivered by non-specialist teachers. Therefore, some have suggested integrating coding into other curricula as a practical solution for non-specialist teachers to deliver outcomes in both Digital Technologies and their own subject areas, whilst also developing general capabilities. To better understand the benefits and practicality of integrating coding into the English curriculum, we present a detailed case study of an Australian Year 5/6 classroom where students engaged in learning units integrating both Digital Technologies and English curriculum outcomes. We explored the nature of students’ interdisciplinary learning and general capabilities development through two learning units in which they coded animated narratives (CANs). We also built understanding of how non-specialist teachers in regular classrooms can develop the necessary technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to facilitate cross-curricular learning involving coding, and at the same time, promote general curriculum capabilities. Findings challenge the commonly held assumption that integrating coding can be a universal solution to specialist staff shortages and an overcrowded curriculum, and reveal the challenges faced by non-specialist teachers and school organisations that need to be overcome for successful implementation. However, they also indicate that when these challenges are met, integrated approaches can result in interdisciplinary learning, high levels of student engagement, and provide effective environments for general capability development.

JOUR ,,,,,"The importance of incorporating digital technologies into early childhood education is now widely accepted to help position children as creative producers and not just consumers of technology. Early childhood educators in turn have a key role to play in developing technology-related skills and competencies such as coding and computational thinking (CT). In response, internationally a range of tangible coding technologies (TCTs), or digital toys, have been created to foster the development of young children’s coding and CT skills. However, to what extent are children’s developing skills and knowledge encouraged by the design of the TCT itself, and the educators’ pedagogy? This article reports on a study into the impact of one TCT, Cubetto, on the CT of a group of young children in an Early Years Learning Centre in Australia, and how educators encouraged coding and CT using Cubetto. The study revealed that Cubetto not only promoted children’s understanding of the nature of digital technologies but encouraged CT skills such as sequencing, cause-and-effect, and foundational numeracy in a collaborative, constructivist way. This was mediated in turn by the educators’ ability to utilise Cubetto effectively in an inquiry-based STEM learning context. Accordingly, this study notes that the incorporation of TCTs can be beneficial but need careful consideration as to their educational purpose and should be supported by developmentally appropriate pedagogical practices to maximise their potential in developing coding skills and CT in young children.

JOUR ,,,,,"Theories linked to embodied cognition emphasise the importance of kinaesthetic learning in shaping higher-order cognitive processing. By spreading the cognitive load to other senses while still contributing to central schema, embodied learning can build long-term memory and engagement, especially in young children, leading to improved performance.

This article reports on the co-design of a digital exhibit in collaboration with a Science Discovery Centre (SDC) intended to encourage CT in young children, underpinned by an embodied cognition approach incorporating whole-body actions. Each stage of the exhibit co-design process was informed by research into embodied cognition as well as competencies associated with CT, namely deconstruction, pattern identification, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, over a 12-month period from conception to fruition. The article describes how theories surrounding embodied cognition and CT were enacted in the realisation process. It concludes by considering the value of co-designing with industry partners such as the SDC, as well as the value of learning designs incorporating kinaesthetic learning especially in relation to abstract concepts such as CT, as embodied knowledge can lead to the construction of enriched mental representations whereby new information is not just seen and heard but is connected to information from the physical environment.

JOUR ,,,,,"This study examines the conceptual understanding of numbers and operations among 372 fifth-grade students, based on their responses to an online three-tier test designed to assess their number sense, declarative knowledge, explanatory knowledge, and confidence. The results showed that most students had low performance and low number sense, with only approximately 18% demonstrating profound conceptual understanding of numbers and operations based on their high performance in five number sense components and high confidence in their solutions. In addition, the majority of students struggled with judging the reasonableness of computational results and solving context-based problems. Furthermore, approximately 78% of participants had misconceptions, with many expressing high confidence in their answers and reasoning.

JOUR ,,,,,"The aim of this study is to examine how algorithmatizing tasks engage mathematics students in algorithmic thinking. Structured, task-based interviews were conducted with eight Year 12 students as they completed a sequence of algorithmatizing tasks involving maximum flow problems. A deductive-inductive analytical process was used to first classify students’ mathematical behavior according to four cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking (decomposition, abstraction, algorithmization, and debugging) and then develop sets of subskills to describe how the students engaged these cognitive skills. The findings show how students used algorithmic thinking to solve maximum flow problems and then made progress towards creating a general algorithm before being introduced to the maximum-flow minimum-cut approach, which guarantees a solution.

JOUR ,,,,,"A theoretical model describing Grade 7 students’ rational number sense was formulated and validated empirically (n = 360), hypothesizing that rational number sense is a general construct consisting of three factors: basic rational number sense, arithmetic sense, and flexibility with rational numbers. Data analysis suggested that rational-number tasks can be categorized based on the validated model. The flexibility component reflects thinking about rational numbers in terms of noticing, using, and expressing relations and properties of numbers in patterns, functions, covariation, and complicated computational tasks. It includes utilizing number structure and relational understanding of operations and numbers. Analysis identified three categories of students that represent different rational-number sense profiles. Category 1 students exhibited a limited basic profile that solved mainly traditional school-based tasks. Category 2 students reflected the basic emergent arithmetic sense profile that responded adequately in operation tasks. Category 3 students represented the flexible emergent profile, as they manipulated underlying structures in a variety of situations, indicating an emergent fundamental shift from an arithmetic to an algebraic focus. A discriminant analysis showed that basic and flexible factors could discriminate students best between the three identified profiles of rational number sense.

JOUR ,,,,,"The rise of interest in data science raises questions about what changes may be needed in how we address the teaching of statistics with primary children. In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school.

JOUR ,,,,,"One central element in understanding the concept of function and developing functional thinking is the aspect of covariation. Covariation describes how the change in one quantity affects the other one. A lack of students’ understanding of covariation leads to errors and misconceptions. This is particularly evident in students’ interpretations of graphs, where covariation is needed to understand the data. Up to now, it is not sufficiently known how students capture covariation in contextual graphs representing data from real-world phenomena. Our study aims to identify secondary school students’ approaches when capturing change in contextual graphs and students’ use of approaches. In our study, 19 ninth graders were asked to describe the change of two graphs from different situational contexts. To get detailed insights into their process of capturing the change, we triangulated eye-tracking data with verbal protocols and stimulated recall interviews. We identified nine approaches that students used to capture change in contextual graphs, which can be grouped into four main types (pairs of values, section by section, holistically, and total change). Moreover, based on students’ use of approaches in the two tasks, we identified task characteristics that seem to be related to the approach used, such as the situational context and the type of graph. The findings thus mark a first step towards improving the teaching and learning of task-specific graph interpretation.

JOUR ,,,,,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can have many adverse effects on people’s health, including cognitive decline and high blood pressure. Typical surgical treatment methods include the commonly performed uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and the highly successful maxillomandibular advancement (MMA). These surgical methods are more effective than non-surgical methods because they widen the airway where a collapse has occurred through direct treatment. However, few studies has shown that moving the upper and lower jaws in a specific manner is the most efficient way to treat OSA during an MMA surgery. In this study, the airway of an OSA patient was reproduced digitally, and computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed on various models with changed airway shapes, including the original model based on an actual CT image and three resizing models of the retropalatal (RP) and retroglossal (RG) regions of the airway. Consequently, it was possible to provide more quantitative predicted flow data, which could be helpful in performing sophisticated OSA surgery. Among the four airway models of the OSA patient, a reduction in the epiglottis regional pressure difference of up to 40.2% was evident in the model with an expanded RG region, and a reduction in the wall shear stress of up to 25.8% was confirmed. The proposed process could be an important aid for surgeons in determining the optimal surgical method suitable for an individual patient’s uniquely-shaped airway.

JOUR ,,,,,"In integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS), crops and animals interact in space-time, generating synergistic properties. ICLS design and implementation are more complex than specialized systems design due to their multiple interactions. Hence, appropriate and innovative methods and tools are required to facilitate design of sustainable ICLS systems. We created a serious game (named SIPA game) as part of a thematic workshop (Farm Coaching) in which gaming fosters participants to attempt ICLS design strategies and experience farm-performance-related consequences. The game was built to provide experiential learning, as the farmers assume the role of farm designers. Besides, researchers and advisors act as mediators of the final scenarios, contributing to reflections on the concepts mobilized and the related technical challenges. We ran four workshops with 90 players in southern Brazil and interviewed 12 ICLS farmers to evaluate their perceptions. The interviews showed that the SIPA game allowed farmers to associate what they had learned in Farm Coaching with their practical experience. The SIPA game encouraged farmers to rethink their performance criteria, shifting from a focus on each component (either crops or livestock) to focusing on the whole system integrated. The game allowed analyzing contrasting scenarios according to their decisions on the groups. Regarding the farmers’ perceptions of peer participants, they indicated crop or livestock backgrounds as an important point of debate. Overall, the game served as a platform for exchanging knowledge and perspectives on ICLS farm design among farmers, researchers, and advisors. Newer versions and scale-up of the game to reach many farmers are expected to be developed, as the game seems to be a promising learning tool for inspiring the adoption of ICLS. The SIPA game is the first tool specific to ICLS farm design that employs system thinking and budget planning associated with temporal soil space use.

JOUR ,,,,,"Bipolar I disorder is a severe neuropsychiatric illness that affects many people around the world. Early diagnosis of adolescents with bipolar I disorder is a very challenging task due to its atypical symptoms. Thirty adolescents, including 15 bipolar I disorder patients and 15 healthy adolescents, participated in the study. These participants were subjected to electroencephalography (EEG), and their EEG signals were recorded through 19 Ag/AgCl electrodes in eyes closed at rest. After preprocessing step to noise reduction and artifacts rejection, three nonlinear features from fractal analysis (Higuchi, Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimension) and three nonlinear features from entropy analysis (sample entropy, permutation entropy, and multiscale entropy) were extracted from cleaned EEGs in the time domain. A multilayer perceptron neural network was utilized for EEG classification. The results showed that fractal features, entropy features, and combined features (i.e., both fractal and entropy features) obtained accuracy of 93.22, 95.74 and 95.52%, respectively. The entropy features yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 95.74%. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity obtained for entropy features were 93.68% and 96.33%, respectively. The obtained results showed that the combination of entropy analysis and neural network is a suitable approach to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Therefore, due to the high accuracy obtained and the simple approach adopted that does not have a high computational cost, this system can be tested in clinical settings. However, more research is needed for the validation of this system.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article introduces and defends the “pathological complexity thesis” as a hypothesis about the evolutionary origins of minimal consciousness, or sentience, that connects the study of animal consciousness closely with work in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology. I argue that consciousness is an adaptive solution to a design problem that led to the extinction of complex multicellular animal life following the Avalon explosion and that was subsequently solved during the Cambrian explosion. This is the economic trade-off problem of having to deal with a complex body with high degrees of freedom, what I call “pathological complexity.” By modeling the explosion of this computational complexity using the resources of state-based behavioral and life history theory we will be able to provide an evolutionary bottom-up framework to make sense of subjective experience and its function in nature by paying close attention to the ecological lifestyles of different animals.

JOUR ,,,,,"Though often presented as a recent scientific endeavor, synthetic biology began in the 19th century and was a particularly active field in the years preceding the publication of D’Arcy Thompson’s On Growth and Form. Much synthetic biology of the era was devoted to the construction of nonliving chemical systems that would undergo morphogenesis or dynamic behaviors which had been observed in living organisms. The point was to show that “life-like” structure and behavior could be generated by physicochemical laws and required no vitalist element. D’Arcy Thompson’s careful analysis of physicochemical morphogenetic mechanisms as possible explanations of organic form links closely to this way of thinking. In the modern era, when we can genetically engineer cells to undergo specific behaviors, and program cells to undergo simple morphogenetic behaviors of the kind that Thompson and others felt might underly natural morphogenesis, it is possible to test whether they will in fact produce a predictable multicellular shape. This addresses essentially the same questions about the morphogenetic role of physicochemical forces, such as surface tension, but does so “the other way round”: physicochemical mechanisms are not being used as models for morphogenesis by natural cells but rather as a means to engineer cells to make designed forms.

JOUR ,,,,,"Disasters and other emergency events have complex effects on human systems, particularly if the events are severe or prolonged. When these types of events happen in rural communities, the resources of the local public health, healthcare, and emergency response organizations can be quickly depleted or overwhelmed. Planning for emergencies can help to mitigate their impact. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods, including computer simulations, can provide insight on how best to prepare for these events and to explore the effects of varying approaches and resource utilization. To best apply these methods for improving disaster management in rural settings, a synthesis of the current body of evidence in this field is needed. The objective of this scoping review was to provide a descriptive overview of the application of computer simulation based on MBSE approaches to disaster preparedness and response for rural healthcare systems. Six studies met inclusion criteria, and varied in terms of MBSE method used, healthcare setting, and disaster type and context considered. We identified a gap in the research regarding the application of MBSE approaches to support rural healthcare disaster preparedness planning efforts. Model-based systems engineering and systems thinking, therefore, represent novel methods for developing tools and computational simulations that could assist rural communities better prepare for disasters.

JOUR ,,,,,"Understanding how a natural computing system like the brain works or learns requires an approach from a different point of view than an artificially developed computing system. Such a natural computing system may first acquire computational properties, which are often not warranted to be computational abilities or intelligence; those properties emerge spontaneously as physical properties in a physics system. The general mechanisms and principles leading to the emergence are worthy of investigation, which may help understand how the brain works or build a computing system artificially inspired by the natural computing system. In this paper, we explore the mechanisms and principles, which provide the grounds for natural computation. Finally, we discuss the difficulties and limitations of a statistical-mechanics-based or reverse-engineering-based approach and suggest the factors to consider in understanding or building a system with high-level computing abilities or intelligence.

Based on keyword analysis, a total of 3798 (period I) and 7175 (period II) keywords were found. Derived from the content analysis, a research typology of two-period keywords was consolidated and framed according to its attributes, including background settings, domain-specific factors, and learning outcomes. Main findings show as follows: (1) Regarding the research background, students from secondary and higher education are the main participants; and computer science, mathematics, and engineering are the major subjects. (2) As the domain-specific factors, game and peer collaboration were found to be the main pedagogies, while web-based and face-to-face learning environments were almost equally referred to in CT research settings. However, compared with traditional command-based tools, Scratch, Lego, and Python were identified as the emerging visual-based programming languages. (3) Finally, the keywords related to learning outcomes were classified based on the Bloom’s framework of three learning domains. First, knowledge and mental understanding are the main goals in the cognitive domain; motivation and attitude are the main tasks in the affective domain; and social and communication skills are the central outcomes in the training of psychomotor ability.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a vital skill for digital citizens in the twenty-first Century. Investigating CT skills and their relationships with demographic and educational factors serve as the basis of CT skills cultivation. However, there is limited research focusing on high school students and inconsistent results regarding the relationship between students’ CT skills and their demographic factors. To fill these gaps, this study explored demographic and educational factors that correlate with high school students’ CT skills in Chinese educational settings. We adopted a cross-sectional research design and employed Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) for K-12 students to measure the CT skills of 1043 students from four urban high schools in northern and southern China. According to the Mann–Whitney U test and the Kruskal–Wallis test, male students outperformed female students in four sub-dimensions of CT skills. Additionally, tenth graders (average age of 16) scored significantly higher in two sub-dimensions of CT skills compared to eleventh graders (average age of 17). While no significant differences in CT skills were found between students from northern and southern China. Furthermore, students’ academic performance in total and their academic performance in English, math, and Information Technology were positively related to their CT skills. We compared our results with previous literature, discussed possible reasons for our findings, and recommended that collaborative, interdisciplinary, problem-based learning experiences that are oriented toward problem-solving should be implemented, especially for female students, to foster high school students’ CT skills.

JOUR ,,,,,"Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells. They form filamentous polymers that are organized in different ways within the cell to perform various functions. For instance, prominent parallel bundles of F-actins mediate the formation and dynamics of filopodia that are long, finger-like protrusions of cell membrane occurring in certain cells, like growing neurons. Understanding actin organization dynamics and its regulation is a crucial problem for biologists that cannot be solved exclusively by biological methods, requiring the support of mathematical and computational modelling. In this work, grounded on a previous hypothesis of ours about the cytosol flow within filopodia, we address several modelling challenges posed by the growth of filopodia in neurons. We use alternative stochastic models and particle-centered numerical methods for transport and elongations, as well as an innovative object-oriented modelling-strategy to represent chemical transformations, polymerization, and their regulation. These modelling strategies allowed for simulating elongations 20 times longer than the typical ranges attained by commonly used filopodia diffusion models, and show that our hypothesis is feasible, acting as a proof-of-concept about the importance of considering organization as a key element in biological explanations.

JOUR ,,,,,"Medical tourism (MT) is a promising industry that has shown significant growth in the past few decades. Patients often travel abroad to seek treatment, conventional and otherwise due to a myriad of reasons. The reasons include but are not limited to rising costs in their home country, experimental treatments only available abroad or better standards of care. However, MT has also created room for intermediaries to grow. These intermediaries are known as medical tourism facilitators (MTF), and as the name suggests, they provide patients services to make their experience easier and more convenient. MTFs often under deliver on their claims to the detriment of the patient. Given the varying legal jurisdiction, the sensitive nature of the healthcare process, and the arduous process of seeking and claiming settlements, most medical tourists are unlikely to pursue cases where they have been cheated. To understand the system of MT and the key issues faced by stakeholders, we used Value Focussed Thinking (VFT). VFT assists to arrive at the fundamental objectives that need to be addressed for mitigating these problems of MT. Based on the findings of VFT; we present a linkage or equivalence between the fundamental objectives for mitigating the problems of MT through Blockchain Technology. We present our findings on how Blockchain Technology can assist to increase disintermediation, transparency, and trust by bringing in aspects of optimizing time and efforts; optimizing expense required to settle disputes, automating disbursement of payments and enforcing mutually accepted agreements among other benefits.

JOUR ,,,,,"Driven by our technologically advanced workplaces and the surge in demand for proficiency in the computing disciplines, it is becoming imperative to provide computational thinking (CT) opportunities to all students. One approach for making computing accessible and relevant to learning and problem-solving in K-12 environments is to integrate it with existing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) curricula. However, novice student learners may face several difficulties in trying to learn STEM and computing concepts simultaneously. To address some of these difficulties, we present a systematic approach to learning STEM and CT by designing and developing domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to aid students in their model building and problem-solving processes. The paper discusses a theoretical framework and the design principles for developing DSMLs, which is implemented as a four-step process. We apply the four-step process in three domains: Physics, Marine Biology, and Earth Science to demonstrate its generality, and then perform case studies to show how the DSMLs impact student learning and model building.

We trained several machine learning classifiers and showed that students’ eye movements provide discriminative information for gender classification. In addition, we employed a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) approach for feature selection and further model interpretation. The classification model trained with the selected (best) eye movement feature set using SHAP achieved improved performance with an average accuracy of over $$70\%$$. The SHAP values further explained the classification model by identifying important features and their impacts on the model output, namely gender. Our findings provide insights into the use of eye movements for in-depth investigations of gender differences in learning activities in VR classroom setups that are ecologically valid and may provide clues for providing personalized learning support and tutoring in such educational systems or optimizing system design.

JOUR ,,,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted teaching and learning activities in higher education around the world. As universities shifted to remote instruction in response to the pandemic, it is important to learn how students engaged in learning during this challenging period. In this paper, we examined the changes in learners’ social and cognitive presence in online discussion forums prior and after remote instruction. We also extracted emergent topics during the pandemic as an attempt to explore what students talked about and how they interacted with their peers. We extracted discussion forum posts between 2019 and 2020 from courses that have been offered repeatedly each term at a four-year university in the U.S. Our findings suggest that students exhibited higher social presence through increased social and affective language during remote instructions. We also identified emergent COVID-19 related discourse, which involved sharing personal experience with positive sentiments and expressing opinions on contemporary events. Our qualitative analysis further revealed that students showed rapport and empathy towrads others, and engaged in active sense making of the pandemic through engaging in critical discourse.   Our study sheds lights on leveraging discussion forum to facilitate learner experiences and building classroom community in online courses. We further discussed the potential for conducting large-scale computational linguistic modeling on learner discourse and the role of artificial intelligence in deriving insights on learning behavior at scale to support remote teaching and learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in education, but mostly to support individual teaching and learning. However, there are good reasons to think that thinking together and solving problems together, Collective Intelligence (CI), is also a valuable outcome of education. Accordingly, our main research question is: How can AI be used effectively to support education for CI? We address this question by means of a literature review and a conceptual analysis in response to the findings of that review. This leads us to propose a three-part framework for thinking about how AI can be used to support education for CI: (i) aiding group formation and composition, (ii) prompting the more effective staging of CI projects, and (iii) improving the process of joint thinking and collaborative problem solving. These three dimensions can be addressed at various levels, from small groups to large collaborations, and in two distinct modes, AI as environment or AI as agent. We conclude the paper with a call for more design-based research of AI, CI and education, building on our proposed framework, developing effective ways to educate students for Collective Intelligence.

JOUR ,,,,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including machine learning (ML), have received attention in education, and generative AI-powered chatbots have been adopted in diverse educational settings worldwide. However, the actual use of and perception regarding generative AI chatbots by learners have been under-investigated. To better prepare for the future of education, it is essential to gain a more accurate understanding of learners’ perceptions, particularly their trust in AI technology because trust in the technology could be closely linked to the successful adoption of these tools in educational settings. To contribute to this understanding, we examined undergraduate students’ trust in generative AI chatbots used in their courses and explored the relationship between their trust levels and learning performance. Additionally, we explored the potential association between learners’ trust levels, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. This research employed an exploratory study design with a regular course setting. We found that learners’ trust levels were not correlated with their computational thinking, self-regulated learning, or learning performance. Furthermore, these constructs (i.e., self-regulated learning, computational thinking, and learning performance) did not significantly predict learners’ trust in AI. However, there was a notable difference between high and low performers concerning changes in trust over time. Trust levels among low performers exhibited a significant change over the semester, whereas those of high performers remained relatively stable. The study suggests that expectations regarding trusting generative AI technology can be influenced by trusting intention through performance.

Then, through a historically informed account of the technical affordances and the epistemic commitments of these two approaches, we highlight how they embody two distinct experimental cultures.

JOUR ,,,,,"We introduce a framework for generating, organizing, and reasoning with computational knowledge. It is motivated by the observation that most problems in Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) can be described as that of completing (from data) a computational graph (or hypergraph) representing dependencies between functions and variables. In that setting nodes represent variables and edges (or hyperedges) represent functions (or functionals). Functions and variables may be known, unknown, or random. Data come in the form of observations of distinct values of a finite number of subsets of the variables of the graph (satisfying its functional dependencies). The underlying problem combines a regression problem (approximating unknown functions) with a matrix completion problem (recovering unobserved variables in the data). Replacing unknown functions by Gaussian processes and conditioning on observed data provides a simple but efficient approach to completing such graphs. Since the proposed framework is highly expressive, it has a vast potential application scope. Since the completion process can be automatized, as one solves $$\sqrt{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}$$on a pocket calculator without thinking about it, one could, with the proposed framework, solve a complex CSE problem by drawing a diagram. Compared to traditional regression/kriging, the proposed framework can be used to recover unknown functions with much scarcer data by exploiting interdependencies between multiple functions and variables. The computational graph completion (CGC) problem addressed by the proposed framework could therefore also be interpreted as a generalization of that of solving linear systems of equations to that of approximating unknown variables and functions with noisy, incomplete, and nonlinear dependencies. Numerous examples illustrate the flexibility, scope, efficacy, and robustness of the CGC framework and show how it can be used as a pathway to identifying simple solutions to classical CSE problems. These examples include the seamless CGC representation of known methods (for solving/learning PDEs, surrogate/multiscale modeling, mode decomposition, deep learning) and the discovery of new ones (digital twin modeling, dimension reduction).

JOUR ,,,,,"In recent years, computational thinking (CT) skills have been globally recognized as a 21st-century skill that must be developed for future generations. However, the lack of validated CT assessments would be a major impediment in the efforts to incorporate CT into the school curriculum. This study is intended to validate the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) using the Rasch model by identifying whether the data fit the Rasch model measurement, determining the CT abilities among a small sample of Singapore secondary students through the test, and examining the presence of test items that functioned differently for gender and grade level of the students. In this study, 153 upper secondary school students from Grade 9 and Grade 10 were involved in a test that required them to do the CTt which comprises 28 test items. The performance of the students in CTt was utilized as quantitative data in this study and was analyzed using the Rasch model. The findings revealed that the data fit the Rasch model measurement. The majority of the male students and ninth-graders had a high level of CT abilities, while most of the female students and tenth-graders had a moderate level of CT abilities. Hence, the male students and ninth-graders performed better than the female students and tenth-graders. Four items functioned differently between male and female students where one gender had a better chance to get the correct answer in these four items compared to the other gender. Only one test item was functioning differently for Grade 9 and Grade 10. This means that the students of one grade level were more likely to obtain the correct answer in this item than the students in the other grade level. This study hopes to contribute to the literature in the area of CT assessments by providing a reference case for scholars and researchers in assessing CT abilities among the students.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the technology acceptance, self-development, and computational thinking skills of teachers who participated in basic robotic coding in-service training from different branches in primary and secondary schools. The research was designed according to the causal comparative research method. The study group consisted of 217 teachers, 106 male and 111 female teachers from different branches working in Amasya and Samsun. Research scales “Self-Improvement in Technology Use in Education,” “Technology Acceptance,” and “Computational Thinking Skills” were used to collect data. Self-improvement scale in technology use in education was developed by Öztürk [Evaluation of social studies teacher nominees? Competency regarding their use of technology in education (Balikesir sample). Unpublished Master Thesis, Gazi University, Ankara, 2006]. There were 14 items in the scale, and internal consistency coefficient was 0.88. Technology acceptance scale for teachers was developed by Ursavaş et al. (J Theory Pract Educ 10(4):885–917, 2014). The scale in total consists of 11 factors and 38 items. The Cronbach’s α coefficient for the factors in the scale was between 0.798 and 0.909. The computational thinking skills scale was developed by Korkmaz Çakır and Özden (2017). The scale consists of 5 factors and 29 items. Cronbach α internal consistency coefficient of the scale was 0.822. When the collected data were analyzed, it was seen that the teachers' self-improvement in technology use ($$\stackrel{-}{{arvec{x}}}=$$3.99) and technology acceptance ($$\stackrel{-}{{arvec{x}}}=$$3.96) were higher. There was statistical significance difference between attending in-service training and not attending in-service training in favor of attending in-service training in self-improvement in technology use in education. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that as teachers’ time in the profession increases, the levels of self-improvement and technology acceptance in technology use decrease in non-attending in-service training group. It is seen that teachers get closer to new developments as they get older and their desire to use technological innovations decreases.

JOUR ,,,,,"Developing students’ computational thinking (CT) to encourage their creative problem-solving skills has increasingly become a focus of K-12 education. However, there is a shortage of capable teachers to implement CT. In this study, we propose a Computational Thinking Teacher Development framework for the design of a teacher development programme. The framework focuses on four content-related dimensions of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model. TCK refers to the use of a block-based programming environment, including its powerful features such as accelerometers, to programme. CK refers to the knowledge of CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. PCK refers to CT pedagogies that do not involve the use of the programming environments, such as unplugged activities and project-based learning. TPACK refers to the integration of technology, pedagogy, and the CK of CT in context for CT development. We further propose a seven-step structure based on these dimensions for learning to teach a unit of curriculum content. The last three steps involve revisiting the TCK for thinking about the possible use of the powerful features for cultivating creativity, revisiting the CK for the consolidation of knowledge, and revisiting the PCK for the improvement of pedagogies for CT. We implemented the programme to 291 in-service teachers, and the evaluation results suggested that the programme was useful in supporting the teachers to teach CT. When asked about the most useful aspect of the programme, the most frequently mentioned answer was the ‘seven steps’. This study contributes to the design of similar programmes for the development of CT teachers.

Visual programming environments are diverse in appearance and prove to be an excellent way to teach pupils the basic ideas of programming. It is important to investigate whether the type of output has a characteristic influence on the level of development of CT in visual programming environments. In this research, we therefore explore whether characteristic differences in the development of CT can be measured when SRA-programming is applied in a visual programming environment with an on-screen output or a tangible output. It was expected that the observed effect of pupils' programming actions through the application of SRA would show that the type of output influences the understanding of complex programming concepts at a higher level. Our results indicate that SRA-programming with visual, on-screen output yields a significant increase in the development of CT, as opposed to SRA-programming with a tangible output.

To investigate the effectiveness of augmented reality-based gamified teaching and learning and the differences in effectiveness under different competitive strategies, this study developed a gamified learning course and the accompanying AR software, and conducted a systematic random sampling of 175 first-year university students to differentiate between different experimental groups, with those who used a team competitive strategy as the control group and those who used an individual competitive strategy as the experimental group, and used the Cultural Literacy, Computational Thinking, Cognitive Load and Game Experience questionnaire instruments to measure learning outcomes. Results showed that the use of augmented reality-based gamification learning strategies significantly improved students' cultural literacy and algorithmic thinking in computational thinking. The collaboration group had a significantly higher sense of positive game experience and cultural literacy than the individual group, while the individual group had significantly higher mental effort and cognitive load than the collaboration group.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper proposes two novel group-based frameworks that can be implemented into almost any nature-inspired optimization algorithm. The proposed Group-Based (GB) and Cross Group-Based (XGB) framework implements a strategy which modifies the attraction and movement behaviors of base nature-inspired optimization algorithms and a mechanism that creates a continuing variance within population groupings, while attempting to maintain levels of computational simplicity that have helped nature-inspired optimization algorithms gain notoriety within the field of feature selection. Through this functionality, the proposed framework seeks to increase search diversity within the population swarm to address issues such as premature convergence, and oscillations within the swarm. The proposed frameworks have shown promising results when implemented into the Bat algorithm (BA), Firefly algorithm (FA), and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), all of which are popular when applied to the field of feature selection, and have been shown to perform well in a variety of domains, gaining notoriety due to their powerful search capabilities.

JOUR ,,,,,"As block-based programming grows in popularity within education, the integration of its application within teacher education programs needs to be investigated. This article examines block-based programming as a viable tool to teach elementary mathematics conceptually drawing on the connections pre-service teachers made between computational thinking and mathematics. This cross-comparative case study that includes a convergent, mixed-methods design examines how block-based coding and computational thinking for conceptual mathematics (B2C3Math) facilitated ten pre-service teachers’ connections made at a large southeastern US university. Connections between computational thinking and mathematics concepts were investigated while the pre-service teachers’ attitudes towards block-based programming as a conceptual mathematics teaching tool were queried. A focus is not placed on interactive games or simulations made using block-based programming to teach mathematics, but rather on pre-service teachers’ ability to design a lesson teaching mathematics conceptually through the programming process. Descriptive analysis reveals changes in pre-service teachers’ attitudes of the proposed teaching strategy following the implementation of B2C3Math. Pre-service teachers’ reflections and lesson designs provide insight into the quality of the connections made between computational thinking and mathematics for the purpose of conceptual mathematics teaching. Three critical cases are identified to illustrate the spectrum of all ten participants in relation to the major findings. Implications for research and practices using block-based programming for teacher education are discussed.

The recent emphasis of programming and computational thinking in K–12 education has highlighted the need to prepare future teachers appropriately to incorporate these technologies in their teaching. This study draws from the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to examine how pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) interaction with robots might influence their intent to use them in teaching. Two groups of such participants engaged in solving mathematical problems using robots in this quasi-experimental pre-/post-test study. Additionally, one of these groups had the chance to design and implement activities that integrated robots with first-grade students. The robots used in this study were Bee-Bots, simple programmable robots that can store up to 40 commands. At the beginning and end of a semester, both groups of participants completed a questionnaire about their perceptions, attitudes, and intentions towards using robots in teaching. In addition, the group who designed and implemented activities with robots provided qualitative reflections about their experience. The study’s quantitative and qualitative findings show that both groups of participants reported significant increases in their intention to use robots in teaching. These findings highlight that opportunities for PSTs to explore, ponder, and experience robotic technologies can promote the integration of these tools in their future teaching.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking (CT) has acquired the status of a necessary 21st-century skill and is currently being introduced in school curricula around the world, despite a lack of consensus about what it entails. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the existing literature on CT activities in primary mathematics education, and to articulate how it is integrated into the teaching and learning of primary mathematics. This systematic review presents and analyses the findings of 10 empirical studies, revealing a recent increased focus on the inclusion of CT in primary mathematics classrooms, as most studies are published around 2020. Our findings indicate two categories of such activities, one focusing on skills (such as mainly sequencing, looping, conditionals, debugging, decomposition, and abstraction) and one on process-oriented activities (communication, creativity, exploration, and engagement). Furthermore, we found that, while there are studies reporting on mathematics being taught directly through CT activities (full integration), in most studies, the mathematics content was emphasised, with CT built in as a way for students to demonstrate their understanding of mathematics concepts (partial integration). This review identifies current gaps in the field and the need to investigate further such process-oriented activities, the use of these activities in accelerated mathematics, and the need for different methodological approaches in primary mathematics.

Even though it is an important competence for understanding the world, dealing with data and information, and solving complex problems, the education system embeds just its simplest operations and only in very early schooling. This study examines six middle school students’ activities as they play, modify, and redesign two Tetris-like classification games on the mathematical concepts of number sets and angle in an online authoring system called Sor.B.E.T (Sorting Based on Educational Technology). The qualitative data analysis of students’ dialogues aimed to bring in the foreground the classification processes students applied and the way these processes were entangled with the development of meanings and ideas on the mathematical concepts embedded in the games. According to the results, the play and modding of the two classification games enabled the development of higher-order classification processes such as objects’ properties comparison, properties discrimination, and classes’ encapsulation. They also supported meaning-making processes and triggered discussions about abstract mathematical notions, such as the concept of angle in various typical mathematical or physical contexts and the concept of number sets, the boundaries of each one, and the relationships among them through exploration and learner-generated exemplification.

The study setting was a computer lab at a Science and Art Center, where students voluntarily enrolled after regular school hours. Data collected from three 7th- grade students included the screen- and audio-recordings of the environment and their screen, question-and-answer sessions and task sheets. Qualitative data were analysed through descriptive analysis based on Hoyles and Noss’s (2015) CT components: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm design. Based on the findings, we observed that students tried to solve problems using the aforementioned components of CT. Through these programming tasks, we observed that, when they abstracted mathematical concepts, they designed the algorithm with different patterns. When the students could not make this abstraction, they carried out the algorithm design process by trial and error. We could claim that CT is related to the mathematisation encountered by the students during the abstraction process.

JOUR ,,,,,"Signal processing has entered the era of big data, and improving processing efficiency becomes crucial. Traditional computing architectures face computational efficiency limitations due to the separation of storage and computation. Array circuits based on multi-conductor devices enable full hardware convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which hold great potential to improve computational efficiency. However, when processing large-scale convolutional computations, there is still a significant amount of device redundancy, resulting in low computational power consumption and high computational costs. Here, we innovatively propose a memristor-based in-situ convolutional strategy, which uses the dynamic changes in the conductive wire, doping area, and polarization area of memristors as the process of convolutional operations, and uses the time required for conductance switching of a single device as the computation result, embodying convolutional computation through the unique spiked digital signal of the memristor. Our strategy reasonably encodes complex analog signals into simple digital signals through a memristor, completing the convolutional computation at the device level, which is essential for complex signal processing and computational efficiency improvement. Based on the implementation of device-level convolutional computing, we have achieved feature recognition and noise filtering for braille signals. We believe that our successful implementation of convolutional computing at the device level will promote the construction of complex CNNs with large-scale convolutional computing capabilities, bringing innovation and development to the field of neuromorphic computing.

Building AI that impact on critical decision-making must be entwined with ethical questioning from the initial conception of design. As academics educating future technologists, we must lead on embedding the importance of ethical thinking for equitable designed systems. Currently, it is unclear across UK Higher Education how widely ethics is taught across programmes of study within computer science disciplines, their importance within the curriculum plus the confidence of academics for its delivery. This paper carries out a survey analysis to identify gaps, measures of engagement, expertise and knowledgebase of topics through both quantitative and qualitative questioning. The survey was distributed to 15 member universities of the Council for Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC) randomly selected across the UK for which 32 academics engaged in the study. Results show ethics was noted as being important although one-third reported it was not widely embedded across the curriculum. Just less than half of participants schedule the teaching of ethics regularly either across one or several modules. Interestingly, 91% of respondents stated that they have not received any instruction or training and that 62% felt that they require more training on the subject matter. This paper is inspired by wider research from European studies however, this study provides a specific novel focus on a broad range of UK universities, providing comparative analysis and unique findings from the UK perspective.

The deterministic random walk is foundational to modeling dynamical processes on complex networks. Inspired by the temporal visualizations offered in NetLogo, we investigated the relationship between network topology and diffusion saturation time for the deterministic random walk model. Our analysis uncovers that in Erdős–Rényi graphs, the saturation time exhibits an asymmetric pattern with a considerable probability of occurrence. This behavior occurs when the hubs, defined as nodes with relatively higher number of connections, emerge in Erdős–Rényi graphs. Yet, our analysis yields that the hubs in Barabási–Albert model stabilize the the convergence time of the deterministic random walk model. These findings strongly suggest that depending on the dynamical process running on complex networks, complementing characteristics other than the degree need to be taken into account for considering a node as a hub. We have made our development open-source, available to the public at no cost at https://github.com/bravandi/NetLogo-Dynamical-Processes.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper outlines an important step in characterizing a novel field of robotic construction research where a cable-driven parallel robot is used to extrude cementitious material in three-dimensional space, and thus offering a comprehensive new approach to computational design and construction, and to robotic fabrication at larger scales. Developed by the Faculty of Art and Design at Bauhaus-University Weimar (Germany), the faculty of Architecture at the University of Applied Sciences Dortmund (Germany) and the Chair of Mechatronics at the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany), this approach offers unique advantages over existing additive manufacturing methods: the system is easily transportable and scalable, it does not require additional formwork or scaffolding, and it offers digital integration and informational oversight across the entire design and building process. This paper considers 1) key research components of cable robotic 3D-printing (such as computational design, material exploration, and robotic control), and 2) the integration of these parameters into a unified design and building process. The demonstration of the approach at full-scale is of particular concern.

We propose a new variant of P systems with reactive membranes, in which every symbol is initially surrounded by an elementary membrane, and in which membranes can non-deterministically merge and split, leading to the formation of bigger and more complicated membranes. We show that such non-deterministic splitting and merging does not seem to radically affect the computational power: P systems with reactive membranes and non-cooperative rules generate at least all semilinear languages, and cooperative rules allow for simulating partially blind register machines. We briefly discuss using P systems with reactive membranes for illustrating the emergence of autocatalytic cycles, but actual constructions are left for future work.

JOUR ,,,,,"The construct of Computational Thinking (CT) first emerged to describe problem solving in the context of computing environments, but it has expanded to serve as a set of practices that can be applied across disciplines with or without the use of computers. We recorded students’ work during two lab sessions in an undergraduate, biology-engineering course to answer the question, how did students’ participation in CT practices vary according the disciplinary contexts and the demands of a biology lab compared to the engineering lab? We found that students applied some of the same CT practices, but these practices were used for different purposes across the two labs. The biology lab allowed for more varied CT practices, in part because students did not have to do any programming. These findings indicate how a biology lab that used a computational model, but not a computer, to understand a biological phenomenon led to meaningful engagement in CT. Documenting the ways that different types of tasks from different disciplines elicit aspects of CT in students can make the construct more useful for designing learning experiences and documenting student learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"Using multiple external representations is advocated for learning in STEM education. This learning approach assumes that multiple external representations promote richer mental representations and a deeper understanding of the concept. In mathematics, the concept of function is a prototypical content area in which multiple representations are used. However, there are hardly any experimental studies investigating the effect of learning functional thinking with multiple representations compared to learning with only one form of representation. Therefore, this article reports on a quasi-experimental intervention study with students from Grade 7, using three measurement time points. The study compared the multi-representational learning of functional thinking with both tables and graphs with mono-representational learning with either tables or graphs. The results show that multi-representational learning led to advantages in learning qualitative functional thinking. However, in quantitative functional thinking, learning with both graphs and tables did not result in higher learning gains than learning exclusively with graphs. Furthermore, students were better able to transfer their knowledge from graphs to tables than vice versa. The results also indicate that multi-representational learning requires more time than mono-representational learning but can lead to higher learning gains. In sum, the results show that the effect of learning with representations is a complex interaction process between learning content and the forms of representation.

JOUR ,,,,,"Understanding complex systems is important in science and has become a prominent aspect of STEM education in recent years. System thinking plays a critical role, focusing on system attributes such as interactions between components, emerging phenomena and hierarchical organisation. In this study, we provide a network analysis of bibliometric information and a research synthesis of empirical studies on system thinking and complexity in STEM education from the past two decades, aiming to identify trends in the field. We reviewed 255 empirical published studies identified from Web of Science database and found a sharp increase in the number of studies on system thinking after 2016. In the research synthesis, we categorised these studies under five categories: (i) study population, (ii) disciplinary field, (iii) empirical study type, (iv) system attributes and (v) cognitive aspects. In the results, we found that most studies focused on higher education (86 papers) and biology (67 papers), while only few of the studies focused on pre- and in-service teachers (14 and 23 papers, respectively) as well as on elementatry students (22 papers). Complexity and interactions emerged as the most mentioned system attributes (89 and 55 papers, respectively), while thinking and understanding were the most mentioned cognitive aspects (112 and 73 papers, respectively). In addition, an increasing focus on digitalisation (68 papers) and modelling (61 papers) was identified. We discuss these emerging trends and identify research gaps and directions for future studies.

To this end, drawings from 104 children aged between 7 and 12 years old were used as a map of representations, considering the drawings as a proxy capable of evoking learned or emerging mental frameworks. The drawings were analyzed in several steps: they were first labeled using binary descriptors and then classified using clustering methods based on Hamming distances between drawings. Finally, questionnaire items covering children’s perceptions about robots were analyzed for each of the resulting cluster separately to identify differences between them. The results show that there are relationships between the way children draw robots and their perception about robots’ capabilities as well as their aspirations to pursue a career in science. These findings can provide meaningful insights into how to design educational robots and learning activities for children to learn with and about robots.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this work, we study the impact of considering agents with distinct norm heterogeneity tolerance levels, and with distinct initial levels of thinking, in the evolution of social norms and levels of thinking in an artificial society. To this end, we generalize an agent-based model first proposed by Joshua M. Epstein to consider agents with distinct tolerance levels to norm heterogeneity in their neighborhoods. In this model, agents that are located in a cyclic network can choose between two norms, want to conform to their neighborhoods, and decide how much to think—i.e., how many neighbors to consult in deciding which norm to follow—analyzing the norm heterogeneity in their surroundings. Through computer simulations of the model, we obtain the following results: (i) when agents have distinct levels of tolerance, the society converges, for a wide range of initial levels of thinking, to a steady state showing higher global diversity (measured by the number of stable local groups formed at the steady state, where contiguous agents within each group conform to the same norm) associated with higher levels of thinking than in scenarios where all agents have the same tolerance level; (ii) for lower initial levels of thinking, more initial thinking implies in faster convergence to the steady state in the cases of heterogeneous tolerance levels, and when agents present homogeneous maximum intolerance levels; (iii) in all scenarios, more thinking is required in the process of reaching the steady state (the equilibrium of the model), than to maintain this equilibrium afterward; (iv) our model was able to generate distinct average levels of thinking across groups; and (v), higher levels of initial thinking imply in a society with less global diversity at the steady state, with this inverse relationship following a broken power law.

JOUR ,,,,,"The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to business ownership in the UK which affects a generation of entrepreneurs and their employees. Nonetheless, the impact remains poorly understood. This is because research on capital accumulation has typically lacked high-quality, individualized, population-level data. We overcome these barriers to examine who benefits from economic crises through a computationally orientated lens of firm creation. Leveraging a comprehensive cache of administrative data on every UK firm and all nine million people running them, combined with probabilistic algorithms, we conduct individual-level analyzis to understand who became Covid entrepreneurs. Using these techniques, we explore characteristics of entrepreneurs—such as age, gender, region, business experience, and industry—which potentially predict Covid entrepreneurship. By employing an automated time series model selection procedure to generate counterfactuals, we show that Covid entrepreneurs were typically aged 35–49 (40.4%), men (73.1%), and had previously held roles in existing firms (59.4%). For most industries, growth was disproportionately concentrated around London. It was therefore existing corporate elites who were most able to capitalize on the Covid crisis and not, as some hypothesized, young entrepreneurs who were setting up their first businesses. In this respect, the pandemic will likely impact future wealth inequalities.

This study aims to explore the potential applications of computational intelligence methods to support educational big data analysis. We begin by discussing the processes involved in educational big data analytics (EDA), including data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, modeling, and evaluation. We then provided an extensive review of computational intelligence and its methods, including artificial intelligence approaches, machine learning methods, deep learning methods, meta-heuristic optimization approaches, ensemble techniques, and the Markov model, as applied to educational big data analysis. Furthermore, we discussed novel application areas for computational intelligence in education, including predicting academic performance, social network analysis, detecting undesirable student behaviors, adaptive curriculum sequencing and personalization, courseware development, and decision support systems. We also mapped various computational intelligence methods to these novel application areas. Despite the progress made in educational big data analytics implementation, challenging research areas still require further investigation.

JOUR ,,,,,"What is the connection between modelling thought and modelling the brain? In a model (as understood here), we strip away from the modelled system some non-essential features and retain some essential ones. What are the essential features of thought that are to be retained in the model, and conversely, what are its inessential features, that may be stripped away in the model? According to a prevalent view in contemporary science and philosophy, thought is a computation, and therefore its essential features are its computational features. A necessary part of the computational view of thought is the idea that the same computation can be realised by, or implemented in, physically heterogeneous systems, an idea known as “Multiple Realizability” of the computational features or properties by the physical ones. I will describe why the very idea of Multiple Realizability, especially in the case of mental computation, entails mind-body dualism, and explore some implications of this conclusion concerning the question of which are the essential features of thought to be retained in modeling it.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this design case is to narrate an iterative design story to develop a series of technology preparation curricula for teacher preparation contextualized in a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Southwest United States. In this initiative, we addressed the incorporation of two critical design elements including computational funds of identity and computational thinking as a problem-solving method in support of inclusive technology-integrated practice and social justice in K-12 learning environments. We reviewed our design phases to address how we framed our design procedure, performed problem analysis, and formulated our design solutions. We prototyped our curriculum to gain insights on teacher candidates’ perceptions of the two incorporated design elements drawing on nuanced learning dynamics. This also enabled us to further refine the balance between our design inquiry and the teacher candidates’ diverse needs. We believe this narrative opens a story of how to advance teacher candidates’ technology competencies and computational thinking in a manner that embraces cultural relevance in response to the rapid development of emerging learning technologies. This in turn contributes to the current instructional design discourse by addressing the interdisciplinary nature of computer science education, educational technology, and social justice for teacher education.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the cognitive, computational, and neuro-sciences, practitioners often reason about what computational models represent or learn, as well as what algorithm is instantiated. The putative goal of such reasoning is to generalize claims about the model in question, to claims about the mind and brain, and the neurocognitive capacities of those systems. Such inference is often based on a model’s performance on a task, and whether that performance approximates human behavior or brain activity. Here we demonstrate how such argumentation problematizes the relationship between models and their targets; we place emphasis on artificial neural networks (ANNs), though any theory-brain relationship that falls into the same schema of reasoning is at risk. In this paper, we model inferences from ANNs to brains and back within a formal framework — metatheoretical calculus — in order to initiate a dialogue on both how models are broadly understood and used, and on how to best formally characterize them and their functions. To these ends, we express claims from the published record about models’ successes and failures in first-order logic. Our proposed formalization describes the decision-making processes enacted by scientists to adjudicate over theories. We demonstrate that formalizing the argumentation in the literature can uncover potential deep issues about how theory is related to phenomena. We discuss what this means broadly for research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology; what it means for models when they lose the ability to mediate between theory and data in a meaningful way; and what this means for the metatheoretical calculus our fields deploy when performing high-level scientific inference.

CP was not observed at the baseline but was evident at the endpoint. Moreover, six of the nine focal students demonstrated a variety of spatial reasoning skills during LEGO® robotics tasks, which are correlated with higher mathematics achievement and academic success. Further analysis revealed that these focal students persisted in problem solving during the LEGO® robotics program.

JOUR ,,,,,"Recent initiatives to promote ‘digitalization’ in education exhorting increased digital literacy and ‘computational thinking’ have invited implementation research methods to transform curricula, teaching, and learning. While conceived as a movement from the present of education to an imagined future where envisaged curricula embrace data-oriented and computational practices across subjects, we ask: whose present? Whose future? We revisit the concept of a metacurriculum (first conceived in the 1990s) as a way of addressing this question, while not avoiding the challenges inherent in the adaptation of education to an increasingly complex postdigital environment. We argue that the principal challenge facing institutional and individual adaptation is increasing environmental uncertainty produced by technology, not deficiency in individual skills. Using the uncertainty concept, we present a practical co-designed and dialogical approach supporting the student and teacher journeys towards the transdisciplinary opportunities opened out by technology, based on a cybernetic model of intersubjectivity. We discuss the explanatory power of uncertainty in this context, focusing on the ways it can encourage dialogue, collegiality, and experimentation. Evidence for this is presented in a case study from a Russian University Business School where a large group of teachers co-designed and delivered a dialogical module on digitalization and interdisciplinarity over a period of 4 years—a collaboration ended by recent geopolitical events. In analyzing data from one of the central activities of this course, we focus on the teacher collegiality and the students’ mechanisms of selection in navigating the transdisciplinary space, and how these mechanisms may provide deeper insight into the dialogical underpinnings of education.

JOUR ,,,,,"In the wake of the digital revolution, the digital teaching of critical thinking takes established forms in higher education. Its technologies are productively understood in postdigital terms as a diverse, inconsistent and cobbled-together collection of platforms and software. This paper considers the limits, problems and advantages of this messy and layered amalgam of technologies. Examining them shows that the benefits of digital critical thinking teaching are frequently bound up with digitisations’ support of sociability and interactivity. This is counterbalanced by difficulties and limits encountered in digitised teaching of critical thinking, often framed as deficiencies in students, teachers, institutions or technologies. However, following Bernard Stiegler’s work and postdigital scholarship, these distinctions can be countered to understand critical thinking technologies as performed within social, technical and psychic milieus processes. Stiegler’s emphasis on temporality allows for a critical analysis of the constraints of digital forms of sociality and interactivity. His notion of otium suggests that techniques cultivating interruptions and layering in digital critical thinking technologies engage their negativity and enable temporal zones in which reflective thought can emerge.

JOUR ,,,,,"Designers and architects usually take inspiration from nature’s forms to develop their designs. Many of nature’s forms are highly sophisticated which only computational and algorithmic designs can be a solution. The purpose of this paper is to create a method and a tool for converting one of crystallization form-finding rules in nature into its use in the architectural style with the digital design approach. For this purpose, the rules of crystallization are modeled geometrically through an algorithm in the visual programing language software. To illustrate the results of this research, a pavilion has been designed using the developed algorithm. In the process of transforming the rules of form-finding of a natural phenomenon into an algorithm, the gap might be too large that the form is no longer similar to the original idea. Nature-based algorithms are so complicated and converting them to mathematical algorithms causes inevitable changes in form-finding. In order to create algorithms inspired by nature, it is not necessary to exactly mimic form-finding in nature. Using this design method, the required function of the form may be affected, and its esthetics and shape will prevail. Therefore, there is a need for a balance between form, function and structure.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this paper, we study the role of narratives in stock markets with a particular focus on the relationship with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic represents a natural setting for the development of viral financial market narratives. We thus treat the pandemic as a natural experiment on the relation between prevailing narratives and financial markets. We adopt natural language processing (NLP) on financial news to characterize the evolution of important narratives. Doing so, we reduce the high-dimensional narrative information to few interpretable and important features while avoiding over-fitting. In addition to the common features, we consider virality as a novel feature of narratives, inspired by Shiller (Am Econ Rev 107:967–1004, 2017). Our aim is to establish whether the prevailing narratives drive or are driven by stock market conditions. Focusing on the coronavirus narratives, we document some stylized facts about its evolution around a severe event-driven stock market decline. We find the pandemic-relevant narratives are influenced by stock market conditions and act as a cellar for brewing a perennial economic narrative. We successfully identified a perennial risk narrative, whose shock is followed by a severe market drop and a long-term increase of market volatility. In the out-of-sample test, this narrative went viral since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, when the pandemic-relevant narratives dominate news media, show negative sentiment and were more linked to “crisis” context. Our findings encourage the use of narratives to evaluate long-term market conditions and to early warn event-driven severe market declines.

JOUR ,,,,,"Digital humanities methods have been at the heart of a recent series of high-profile historical research projects. But these approaches raise new questions about reproducibility and verifiability in a field of research where grounding one’s conclusions in a body of historical evidence is crucial. While there have been extensive debates about the nature and methods of historical research since the nineteenth century, the underlying assumption has generally been that documenting one’s sources in a series of footnotes is essential to enable other researchers to test the validity of the research. Even if this approach never amounted to “reproducibility” in the sense of scientific experimentation, it might still be seen as broadly analogous, since the evidence can be reassembled to see the basis for the explanations that were offered and to test their validity. This essay examines how new digital methods like topic modelling, network analysis, knowledge graphs, species models, and various kinds of visualizations are affecting the process of reproducing and verifying historical research.

JOUR ,,,,,"5G wireless technology has fundamentally revolutionized the way in which the users communicate as a result of its -fast speeds, increased latency, and dependable connections. The Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, or NOMA, protocol is an essential component of 5G since it enables the dynamic allocation of resources to multiple users at the same time. However, issues with peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and increasing bit error rate (BER) prevent the transmission from functioning to its full capacity. The aim of this research is to enhance the transmission sequence of 5G NOMA networks. Conventional methods reduce lower PAPR by utilizing a variety of optimization methods resulted in failure due to the computational complexity of the problem. This research offers the Levy Flight-based Bee Swarm Optimized Optimal Transmission Sequence (LFBBSOPTS) Method for 5G wireless communication by leveraging the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) approach. Levy Flight is a stochastic process with lengthy jumps that is motivated by natural foraging habits. The Bee Swarm Optimization model takes advantage of this process to determine optimal transmission sequences. This technique aims to reduce the load of computing while accelerating the reduction of PAPR to the greatest extent possible in the shortest amount of time. Bees, which stand for sequential data input, perform the function of search agents in this technique by wandering the search space in real time in an effort to find the solutions that are the most appropriate. The incorporation of Levy Flight ensures that a thorough examination of the solution space will take place, which helps to avoid the issues that are connected with early convergence.

JOUR ,,,,,"It is important to compute the Hilbert transform of a given function defined on a finite interval. In 2013, Micchelli and his collaborators proposed a fast algorithm, which is called the Hilbert spline transform, to calculate the Hilbert transform of a given function on a finite interval with the computational complexity $$O(n\log n)$$, where the spline knots were chosen to be the midpoints of sampling points. A natural question is that, whether or not the spline knots can be chosen to be the same as the sampling points. This paper gives a positive answer to this question. Besides, the analytic expression of the Hilbert transform of B-splines of any order is also established. Furthermore, the problem of how to choose spline coefficients, using the quasi-interpolation method or interpolation method, is also considered, although both make sure an optimal approximation order. Several interesting numerical examples are implemented and compared with most of the existing methods. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm has a relatively high computational accuracy as well as a relatively low computational complexity.

Operational design is a method of structured team discourse used by military planners for rapidly envisioning complex systems and relationships; however, the products are typically static diagrams on whiteboards or slides. DARPAs Causal Exploration program seeks to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) assistance and causal analytics to enable rapid system modeling and analysis. We introduce Causeworks, an application in which operators “sketch” complex systems, leverage AI tools and expert knowledge to transform the sketches into computational causal models, and then apply analytics to understand how to influence the system. We walk through human–machine collaborative model building using Causeworks and discuss feedback and lessons learned about how to flexibly apply causal modeling and thinking for expert planners that are novice modelers.

The propeller, which is a critical component of the propulsion system, must be designed with multiple constraints and objectives to satisfy the need. Recent studies propose that utilizing an improved optimization algorithm and computational analysis would explore better designs than conventional methods. In the present study, the elitist particle swarm optimization (EPSO) technique is implemented to optimize the design of a marine propeller. Potsdam’s Conventional Propeller VP 1304 is used as a benchmark design case. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) along with vortex lattice method (VLM) and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is used for computational analysis. The results obtained in this study are validated against the previously published experimental data. An optimized propeller design is proposed based on the elitist particle swarm optimization technique. It is observed that the proposed design shows improved open water performance for lower advance coefficient (J) values based on the given constraints. It is also observed that open water efficiency is improved by 7% for $$J=0.6$$compared to the original design. The one-way fluid-structure interaction analysis shows that the proposed design is structurally stable under open water test conditions.

Language-related systems are no exception. Besides, language matters are never just language matters. Their causes and consequences are to be found in many seemingly unrelated fields. Therefore, we can no longer overlook the numerous variables involved in the unfolding of linguistic and sociolinguistic phenomena if we wish to develop effective language policy measures.

The AI algorithms we develop and deploy to make sense of information, are informed by data, and based on models that capture and use pertinent details of the population or phenomenon being analyzed.

This must be done without violating basic assumptions of the algorithms in use. Algorithmic results need to be clearly communicated to stakeholders and domain experts to enable sound conclusions. Our position is that AI holds great promise for supporting precision medicine, but we need to move forward with great care, with consideration for possible ethical implications.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article describes an alternative starting point for embedding human values into artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As applications of AI become more versatile and entwined with society, an ever-wider spectrum of considerations must be incorporated into their decision-making. However, formulating less-tangible human values into mathematical algorithms appears incredibly challenging. This difficulty is understandable from a viewpoint that perceives human moral decisions to primarily stem from intuition and emotional dispositions, rather than logic or reason. Our innate normative judgements promote prosocial behaviours which enable collaboration within a shared environment. Individuals internalise the values and norms of their social context through socialisation. The complexity of the social environment makes it impractical to consistently apply logic to pick the best available action. This has compelled natural agents to develop mental shortcuts and rely on the collective moral wisdom of the social group. This work argues that the acquisition of human values cannot happen just through rational thinking, and hence, alternative approaches should be explored. Designing receptiveness to social signalling can provide context-flexible normative guidance in vastly different life tasks. This approach would approximate the human trajectory for value learning, which requires social ability. Artificial agents that imitate socialisation would prioritise conformity by minimising detected or expected disapproval while associating relative importance with acquired concepts. Sensitivity to direct social feedback would especially be useful for AI that possesses some embodied physical or virtual form. Work explores the necessary faculties for social norm enforcement and the ethical challenges of navigating based on the approval of others.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper explores the surprising resonance between Martin Heidegger’s situated ontology—focused on practical immersion in shared worlds—and artificial intelligence (AI) systems that transcend formal constraints through data-driven learning. Heidegger's understanding of truth and thinking as emerging through contextual engagement parallels how machine learning algorithms rely on real-world interactions to develop advanced functions. The analysis advocates integrating Heideggerian perspectives with John Dewey’s consequentialist ethical orientation, emphasizing that responsibility must be sensitive to the evolving societal impacts of actions rather than fixed by a priori principles. This pragmatic approach calls for policy frameworks as adaptable to societal changes as the AI systems they govern. To illustrate this, the paper develops a reinforcement learning model that balances utilitarian and deontological ethical considerations in promoting social participation through AI. This model demonstrates how philosophical concepts can be integrated into algorithm design and assessment, resulting in participatory, transparent, and inquiry-driven policy frameworks attuned to the situational impacts of AI systems rather than rigid constraints.

In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) is a smart technology increasingly used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policing, where its decisions can cause moral harm. In this paper, we argue that AI, particularly artificial agents that autonomously make decisions to pursue their goals, challenge the neutrality thesis. Our central claim is that the computational models underlying artificial agents can integrate representations of moral values such as fairness, honesty and avoiding harm. We provide a conceptual framework discussing the neutrality thesis, values, and AI. Moreover, we examine two approaches to designing computational models of morality, artificial conscience and ethical prompting, and present empirical evidence from text-based game environments that artificial agents with such models exhibit more ethical behavior compared to agents without these models.

JOUR ,,,,,"In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is placing increased emphasis on computation. The presence of substantial gender disparities in many computationally intensive disciplines suggests that the adoption of computational instruction approaches that lack intentionality may exacerbate gender disparities. Educational research suggests that the development of an engineering and computational identity is one factor that can support students’ decisions to enter and persist in an engineering major. Discipline-based identity research is used as a lens to understand retention and persistence of students in engineering. Our specific purpose is to apply discipline-based identity research to define and explore the computational identities of undergraduate engineering students who engage in computational environments. This work will inform future studies regarding retention and persistence of students who engage in computational courses. Twenty-eight undergraduate engineering students (20 women, 8 men) from three engineering majors (biomedical engineering, agricultural engineering, and biological engineering) participated in semi-structured interviews. The students discussed their experiences in a computationally-intensive thermodynamics course offered jointly by the Biomedical Engineering and Agricultural & Biological Engineering departments. The transcribed interviews were analyzed through thematic coding. The gender stereotypes associated with computer programming also come part and parcel with computer programming, possibly threatening a student's sense of belonging in engineering. The majority of the participants reported that their computational identity was “in the making.” Students’ responses also suggested that their engineering identity and their computational identity were in congruence, while some incongruence is found between their engineering identity and a creative identity as well as between computational identity and perceived feminine norms. Responses also indicate that students associate specific skills with having a computational identity. This study's findings present an emergent thematic definition of a computational person constructed from student perceptions and experiences. Instructors can support students’ nascent computational identities through intentional mitigation of the gender stereotypes and biases, and by framing assignments to focus on developing specific skills associated with the computational modeling processes.

Based on initial findings in our pilot program, we anticipate that these techniques will enable students with limited prior computational experience to feel more comfortable and able to complete tasks, thereby increasing their self-efficacy and STEM identity. These modules could be a valuable tool for practitioners teaching high school or early college-level computational courses who instruct students with varied coding experience. Additionally, our analysis of the use of a female-oriented problem statement on female-identifying students' perceived self-efficacy provides potential evidence of the usefulness of representative problem statements in engaging underrepresented student populations. These techniques could be adapted to address a variety of contexts across STEM disciplines and other fields to foster inclusive learning environments.

JOUR ,,,,,"The design of biological systems is a multidisciplinary activity in which biomedical engineers collaborate to build novel biological systems that address society’s needs. One of the most relevant skills for designing biological systems is engineering systems thinking (EST). Among the EST elements, the EST cognitive competencies are comparatively less explored. Particularly, there is a lack of understanding of how undergraduate engineering students manifest EST cognitive competencies in synthetic biology so instructors and curriculum designers can better scaffold students’ learning. In this study, we contribute to that gap by addressing the question: To what extent do multidisciplinary undergraduate teams exhibit EST cognitive competencies when designing a biological system to address societal needs?. We followed a Qualitative Descriptive Research approach to analyze the EST cognitive competencies of five teams who successfully framed a problem and developed a functional biological system as part of their participation in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. We coded the publicly available teams’ wikis where they registered their design process using the Capacity for Engineering Systems Thinking (CEST) model and procedures from document analysis. The wikis included evidence of seven of the ten EST cognitive competencies from the CEST model. The studied undergraduate participants framed complex problems, designed systems that typically included various subsystems (e.g., biological, mechanical, electrical) and integrated multiple disciplinary concepts and tools. The participants used various approaches to handle the interconnection and synergistic properties of the elements in their biological systems, such as representing their systems at different levels of detail. Competition judges and advisor can support their teams’ EST using our findings. Furthermore,  we propose a framework to explore the EST cognitive competencies of undergraduate students in the context of biological synthetic design and suggest how instructors and other interested readers may use our findings to develop learning environments that promote EST.

Central to SISS is the recognition of geographical concepts such as distance, distribution, and location, which shape societal dynamics and human interactions. Supported by diverse theoretical paradigms and advanced analytical tools, we discuss nine opportunities embedded within SISS to contribute to new theories and techniques for capturing, mapping, and modelling spatial data.

JOUR ,,,,,"Design methods, frameworks, and green building certifications have been developed to create a sustainable built environment. Despite sustainability advancements, urgent action remains necessary due to climate change and the high impact of the built environment. Regenerative Design represents a shift from current practices focused on reducing environmental impacts, as it aims to generate positive effects on both human and natural systems. Although digital design methods are commonly employed in sustainable design practice and research, there is presently no established framework to guide a digital regenerative design process. This study provides an analysis of existing literature on regenerative design and digital design methods and presents a framework based on building information modelling (BIM) methodology and computational design methods, that can be applied to both urban and building design. This framework identifies digital tools and organizes indicators based on the pillars of climate, people, and nature for regenerative design, drawing upon a comprehensive analysis of literature, including standards, sustainability frameworks and research studies. The framework is illustrated through a case study evaluation. The paper also highlights the potential and limitations of digital methods concerning regenerative design and suggests possibilities for future expansion by incorporating additional quantifiable indicators that reflect research developments, to achieve positive outcomes.

Indeed, digital twins have long served as models of technical and cyber-physical processes. Human digital twins have such models as their foundations but also include models of human actions. As a result, human digital twin models enable technology designers to model how people interact with intelligent technical artifacts. Yet, development of human digital twins is associated with certain conceptual problems. To clarify the basic idea, we constructed a human digital twin for Minsky’s M-Machine.

Effective instruction by skilled professionals is crucial for maximizing the benefits of aerobics, ensuring participants' correct and safe performance. This study introduces the concept of Aerobics Movement Teaching, emphasizing its pivotal role in college physical education. The proposed method, Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network optimized with big data for teaching Aerobics (AP-CNN-BTA), focuses on enhancing aesthetic ability and overall human development. Data from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation Data Set are collected, preprocessed, and utilized in the teaching process using the Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network, specifically designed for efficient aerobics instruction in coastal areas. The resulting data are stored in the cloud and accessed through a human interface unit. The implementation, carried out in Python, undergoes evaluation using various metrics, including accuracy, computational time, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and ROC analysis. The simulation results demonstrate a remarkable improvement, with the proposed technique achieving 36.52%, 39.55%, and 43.75% higher accuracy compared to existing methods such as Exploration on and thinking about aesthetic infiltration in aerobics teaching in colleges and universities(ETAI-AT-CU), sea level height depending on big data of the Internet of Things along aerobics teaching in coastal regions(SLH-BD-IOT-ATC), and impact of deep learning-based curriculum's ideological and political integration on sports aerobics instruction design(IP-CDL-TDTA), respectively.

JOUR ,,,,,"Thinking about the universe also includes thinking about hypothetical extraterrestrial intelligence. Two key questions arise: Why are we thinking about them in the first place? And why are we anthropomorphizing them? One possible explanation may be that the belief in extraterrestrials results from a subjective feeling of loneliness or the need for closure. Results of an online questionnaire (N = 130) did not reveal a confident and consistent correlation between personal feelings of aloneness or need for closure and belief in extraterrestrial life or intelligence. The same was true for the anthropomorphic representation of extraterrestrial intelligence. The belief in extraterrestrial life was negatively linked to frequent religious activity, and to a lesser and more uncertain extent, to the belief in extraterrestrial intelligence. As evidenced by their parameter estimates, participants demonstrated an intuitive grasp of the probabilities inherent in the Drake equation. However, there was significant variability in the solutions provided. When asked to describe hypothetical extraterrestrials, participants mainly assessed them in terms connoted with physical appearance, neutral to humans, and partially influenced by anthropomorphism. Given the severe limitations, we conservatively conclude that individual loneliness is indeed individual and does not break the final frontier, that is, space.

The effort to rephrase the text of the law in algorithmic terms revealed that the election procedure is under-specified, so that the allocation of seats between constituencies may differ depending on the actual sequence of ballot operations performed by the scrutineers. This may lead to legal uncertainty in a critical section of the election law that one would expect to be fully determined. We then discuss the difference between algorithm and software in the legal context, illustrating how the algorithmic language acts as an interface between the textual description of a legal procedure and its mathematical or computational formalization.

However, only 34 were randomly selected to participate in the study. An achievement test and structured interview were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The quantitative data obtained from pre- and post-tests were analyzed using a paired t test, and the data from the interview was analyzed by descriptive, and interpretive analyses. It was revealed that secondary school teachers have a respectable conception and constructive reflection of Scratch programming once attending scratch training. Quantitative findings showed that there was an important difference in the mean among pre- and post-tests with 0.171 learning gain and an effect size of 0.53 (df = 33, p < 0.05). It was also revealed that Scratch is an operational instructional tool for teaching and learning Mathematics and Sciences.

While there exists decades’ worth of pedagogical research on teaching introductory statistics to non-statistics majors, few systematic attempts have been made to explore innovative ways to teaching follow-on courses to non-statistics majors such as public health students. Extending previous research on teaching categorical data analysis to public health students, this paper explores ways to harness the power of computational thinking in teaching conceptual knowledge in a follow-on course on longitudinal data analysis. The proposed approach aims to keep students in their zone of proximal development by using computational experiments as a tool for developing understanding of conceptual knowledge. Learning activities center on experiments that explore the likelihood function.

JOUR ,,,,,"Creative thinking represents a major evolutionary mechanism that greatly contributed to the rapid advancement of the human species. The ability to produce novel and useful ideas, or original thinking, is thought to correlate well with unexpected, synchronous activation of several large-scale, dispersed cortical networks, such as the default network (DN). Despite a vast amount of correlative evidence, a causal link between default network and creativity has yet to be demonstrated. Surgeries for resection of brain tumors that lie in proximity to speech related areas are performed while the patient is awake to map the exposed cortical surface for language functions. Such operations provide a unique opportunity to explore human behavior while disrupting a focal cortical area via focal electrical stimulation. We used a novel paradigm of individualized direct cortical stimulation to examine the association between creative thinking and the DN. Preoperative resting-state fMRI was used to map the DN in individual patients. A cortical area identified as a DN node (study) or outside the DN (controls) was stimulated while the participants performed an alternate-uses-task (AUT). This task measures divergent thinking through the number and originality of different uses provided for an everyday object. Baseline AUT performance in the operating room was positively correlated with DN integrity. Direct cortical stimulation at the DN node resulted in decreased ability to produce alternate uses, but not in the originality of uses produced. Stimulation in areas that when used as network seed regions produced a network similar to the canonical DN was associated with reduction of creative fluency. Stimulation of areas that did not produce a default-like network (controls) did not alter creative thinking. This is the first study to causally link the DN and creative thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"To navigate social interactions successfully, humans need to continuously learn about the personality traits of other people (e.g., how helpful or aggressive is the other person?). However, formal models that capture the complexities of social learning processes are currently lacking. In this study, we specify and test potential strategies that humans can employ for learning about others. Standard Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning models only capture parts of the learning process because they neglect inherent knowledge structures and omit previously acquired knowledge. We therefore formalize two social knowledge structures and implement them in hybrid RW models to test their usefulness across multiple social learning tasks. We name these concepts granularity (knowledge structures about personality traits that can be utilized at different levels of detail during learning) and reference points (previous knowledge formalized into representations of average people within a social group). In five behavioural experiments, results from model comparisons and statistical analyses indicate that participants efficiently combine the concepts of granularity and reference points—with the specific combinations in models depending on the people and traits that participants learned about. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that variants of RW algorithms, which incorporate social knowledge structures, describe crucial aspects of the dynamics at play when people interact with each other.

We leveraged longitudinal data from a cohort of healthy adolescents (n = 570, aged 14–25), which included decision-making and psychometric data, to characterise normative developmental trajectories of trust behaviour and inter-individual differences therein. Extending on previous cross-sectional findings from the same cohort, we show that a task-based measure of trust increases longitudinally from adolescence into young adulthood. Computational modelling suggests this is due to a decrease in social risk aversion. Self-reported family adversity attenuates this developmental gain in trust behaviour, and within our computational model, this relates to a higher ‘irritability’ parameter in those reporting greater adversity. Unconditional trust at measurement time point T1 predicts the longitudinal trajectory of self-reported peer relation quality, particularly so for those with higher family adversity, consistent with trust acting as a resilience factor.

JOUR ,,,,,"The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is a leading candidate for advanced quantum information processing. In current QCCD implementations, imperfect ion transport and anomalous heating can excite ion motion during a calculation. To counteract this, intermediate cooling is necessary to maintain high-fidelity gate performance. Cooling the computational ions sympathetically with ions of another species, a commonly employed strategy, creates a significant runtime bottleneck. Here, we demonstrate a different approach we call exchange cooling. Unlike sympathetic cooling, exchange cooling does not require trapping two different atomic species. The protocol introduces a bank of “coolant"" ions which are repeatedly laser cooled. A computational ion can then be cooled by transporting a coolant ion into its proximity. We test this concept experimentally with two 40Ca+ ions, executing the necessary transport in 107 μs, an order of magnitude faster than typical sympathetic cooling durations. We remove over 96%, and as many as 102(5) quanta, of axial motional energy from the computational ion. We verify that re-cooling the coolant ion does not decohere the computational ion. This approach validates the feasibility of a single-species QCCD processor, capable of fast quantum simulation and computation. ",,,"Brown, Kenton R.

Fluorescence responses of the PDA particle are directly monitored in real time using fluorescent microscopy.

JOUR ,,,,,"Throughout their lives, humans seem to learn a variety of rules for things like applying category labels, following procedures, and explaining causal relationships. These rules are often algorithmically rich but are nonetheless acquired with minimal data and computation. Symbolic models based on program learning successfully explain rule-learning in many domains, but performance degrades quickly as program complexity increases. It remains unclear how to scale symbolic rule-learning methods to model human performance in challenging domains. Here we show that symbolic search over the space of metaprograms—programs that revise programs—dramatically improves learning efficiency. On a behavioral benchmark of 100 algorithmically rich rules, this approach fits human learning more accurately than alternative models while also using orders of magnitude less search. The computation required to match median human performance is consistent with conservative estimates of human thinking time. Our results suggest that metaprogram-like representations may help human learners to efficiently acquire rules. ",,,"Tenenbaum, Joshua B.

JOUR ,,,,,"Quantum theory promises computational speed-ups over classical approaches. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem implies that the full power of quantum computation resides in the specific resource of “magic” states—the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computation. However, it is still questionable whether magic indeed brings the believed quantum advantage, ridding unproven complexity assumptions or black-box oracles. In this work, we demonstrate the first unconditional magic advantage: a separation between the power of generic constant-depth or shallow quantum circuits and magic-free counterparts. For this purpose, we link the shallow circuit computation with the strongest form of quantum nonlocality—quantum pseudo-telepathy, where distant non-communicating observers generate perfectly synchronous statistics. We prove quantum magic is indispensable for such correlated statistics in a specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system. Then, we translate generating quantum pseudo-telepathy into computational tasks, where magic is necessary for a shallow circuit to meet the target. As a by-product, we provide an efficient algorithm to solve a general linear binary constraint system over the Pauli group, in contrast to the broad undecidability in constraint systems. We anticipate our results will enlighten the final establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum computation.

As the desire to perform high-throughput screening increases, it becomes challenging to use heuristics and intuition alone. In this paper, we demonstrate machine learning potentials can be leveraged to identify low-energy adsorbate-surface configurations more accurately and efficiently. Our algorithm provides a spectrum of trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, with one balanced option finding the lowest energy configuration 87.36% of the time, while achieving a ~2000× speedup in computation.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational semantics, a branch of computational linguistics, involves automated meaning analysis that relies on how words occur together in natural language. This offers a promising tool to study schizophrenia. At present, we do not know if these word-level choices in speech are sensitive to the illness stage (i.e., acute untreated vs. stable established state), track cognitive deficits in major domains (e.g., cognitive control, processing speed) or relate to established dimensions of formal thought disorder. In this study, we collected samples of descriptive discourse in patients experiencing an untreated first episode of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (246 samples of 1-minute speech; n = 82, FES = 46, HC = 36) and used a co-occurrence based vector embedding of words to quantify semantic similarity in speech. We obtained six-month follow-up data in a subsample (99 speech samples, n = 33, FES = 20, HC = 13). At baseline, semantic similarity was evidently higher in patients compared to healthy individuals, especially when social functioning was impaired; but this was not related to the severity of clinically ascertained thought disorder in patients. Across the study sample, higher semantic similarity at baseline was related to poorer Stroop performance and processing speed. Over time, while semantic similarity was stable in healthy subjects, it increased in patients, especially when they had an increasing burden of negative symptoms. Disruptions in word-level choices made by patients with schizophrenia during short 1-min descriptions are sensitive to interindividual differences in cognitive and social functioning at first presentation and persist over the early course of the illness.

JOUR ,,,,,"Education is central to the acquisition of knowledge, such as when children learn new concepts. It is unknown, however, whether educational differences impact not only what concepts children learn, but how those concepts come to be represented in semantic memory—a system that supports higher cognitive functions, such as creative thinking. Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds—Montessori and traditional, matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence—to examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, including creative thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"This article reviews the current knowledge and recent advancements in computational modeling of the cell cycle. It offers a comparative analysis of various modeling paradigms, highlighting their unique strengths, limitations, and applications. Specifically, the article compares deterministic and stochastic models, single-cell versus population models, and mechanistic versus abstract models. This detailed analysis helps determine the most suitable modeling framework for various research needs. Additionally, the discussion extends to the utilization of these computational models to illuminate cell cycle dynamics, with a particular focus on cell cycle viability, crosstalk with signaling pathways, tumor microenvironment, DNA replication, and repair mechanisms, underscoring their critical roles in tumor progression and the optimization of cancer therapies. By applying these models to crucial aspects of cancer therapy planning for better outcomes, including drug efficacy quantification, drug discovery, drug resistance analysis, and dose optimization, the review highlights the significant potential of computational insights in enhancing the precision and effectiveness of cancer treatments.

MOFs could have a critical role in many energy technologies, including carbon capture, separations and storage of energy carriers. Molecular simulations can improve our molecular-level understanding of adsorption in MOFs, and it is now possible to use realistic models for these complicated materials and predict their adsorption properties in quantitative agreement with experiments. Here we review the predictive design and discovery of MOF adsorbents for the separation and storage of energy-relevant molecules, with a view to understanding whether we can reliably discover novel MOFs computationally prior to laboratory synthesis and characterization. We highlight in silico approaches that have discovered new adsorbents that were subsequently confirmed by experiments, and we discuss the roles of high-throughput computational screening and machine learning.

Simulations show effects of memory age and hippocampal lesions in agreement with previous models, but also provide mechanisms for semantic memory, imagination, episodic future thinking, relational inference and schema-based distortions including boundary extension.

JOUR ,,,,,"A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to plan multiple steps into the future1,2. Despite decades of research3–5, it is still debated whether skilled decision-makers plan more steps ahead than novices6–8. Traditionally, the study of expertise in planning has used board games such as chess, but the complexity of these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of planning depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive science often have a lower complexity9,10 and impose a ceiling for the depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods to show that human behaviour can be captured using a computational cognitive model based on heuristic search. To validate this model, we predict human choices, response times and eye movements. We also perform a Turing test and a reconstruction experiment. Using the model, we find robust evidence for increased planning depth with expertise in both laboratory and large-scale mobile data. Experts memorize and reconstruct board features more accurately. Using complex tasks combined with precise behavioural modelling might expand our understanding of human planning and help to bridge the gap with progress in artificial intelligence.

Although such deliberations are critical for making sound decisions, the underlying reasoning strategies and neurobiological substrates remain poorly understood. Here two nonhuman primates performed a combinatorial optimization task to identify valuable subsets and satisfy predefined constraints. Their behavior revealed evidence of combinatorial reasoning—when low-complexity algorithms that consider items one at a time provided optimal solutions, the animals adopted low-complexity reasoning strategies. When greater computational resources were required, the animals approximated high-complexity algorithms that search for optimal combinations. The deliberation times reflected the demands created by computational complexity—high-complexity algorithms require more operations and, concomitantly, the animals deliberated for longer durations. Recurrent neural networks that mimicked low- and high-complexity algorithms also reflected the behavioral deliberation times and were used to reveal algorithm-specific computations that support economic deliberation.

Such eye movements correlate strongly with the spatial layout of the recalled image content and function as memory cues facilitating the retrieval procedure. However, how close the correlation is between imagery eye movements and the eye movements while looking at the original image is unclear so far. In this work we first quantify the similarity of eye movements between recalling an image and encoding the same image, followed by the investigation on whether comparing such pairs of eye movements can be used for computational image retrieval. Our results show that computational image retrieval based on eye movements during spontaneous imagery is feasible.

The findings provide further evidence of the MN12SX density functional’s superiority in proving the Janak and Ionization Energy theorems using the proposed KID approach. This has proven to be beneficial in accurately predicting CDFT reactivity characteristics, which aid in the understanding of chemical reactivity.

JOUR ,,,,,"Multi-fractured horizontal wells have enabled commercial production from low-permeability (‘tight’) hydrocarbon reservoirs but recoveries remain exceedingly small (< 5–10%). As a result, operators have investigated the use of solvent (gas) injection schemes, such as huff-n-puff (HNP), to improve oil recovery. Previous HNP laboratory approaches, classified primary as ‘flow-through-matrix’ and ‘flow-around-matrix’ typically (1) are not fully representative of field conditions at near-fracture regions and (2) require long test times, even when performed on fractured cores. The objectives of this proof-of-concept study are to (1) design and implement a new experimental procedure that better reproduces HNP schemes in near-fracture regions and (2) use the results, simulated with a compositional lab-calibrated model, to explore the controls on enhanced hydrocarbon recovery in depleted tight oil plays. Performing multiple CO2 and (simplified) lean gas HNP cycles, the integrated experimental and simulation approach proposed herein achieves the ultimate recovery factors in a significantly shorter time frame (25–50%) compared to previous studies.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left DLPFC, in function of self-critical rumination tendencies, momentarily reduces counterfactual thinking and regret (assessed via self-report and psychophysiological indices). Eighty healthy participants with different levels of self-critical rumination received either anodal or sham tDCS while performing a decision making task in which they were repeatedly confronted with optimal, suboptimal, and non-optimal choice outcomes. The results showed that among rumination-prone individuals, anodal (versus sham) tDCS was associated with decreased CFT and attenuated psychophysiological reactivity to the differential choice outcomes. Conversely, among low rumination-prone individuals, anodal (versus sham) tDCS was associated with increased CFT and regret, but in absence of any effects on psychophysiological reactivity. Potential working mechanisms for these differential tDCS effects are discussed. Taken together, these results provide initial converging evidence for the adaptive effects of left prefrontal tDCS on CFT and regret to personal choice outcomes among individuals prone to engage in self-critical rumination.

In particular, a potential of machine learning to obtain the capability to identify a part of material structures that critically affects a physical property without human prior knowledge is mainly discussed. The guide for constructing the machine learning framework adopted in this paper is to imitate human researchers’ process of thinking in the interpretation and development of materials. Our framework was applied to the optimization of structures of artificial dual-phase steels in terms of a fracture property. A comparison of results of the framework with those of numerical simulation based on governing physical laws demonstrated the potential of our framework for the identification of a part of microstructures critically affecting the target property.

In addition, many clinical studies highlight a relationship between poor inner-speech and an executive impairment in autism spectrum condition (ASC), but contrasting findings are reported. Here we directly investigate the latter issue through a previously implemented and validated computational model of the Wisconsin Cards Sorting Tests. In particular, the model was applied to explore potential individual differences in cognitive flexibility and inner speech contribution in autistic and neurotypical participants. Our model predicts that the use of inner-speech could increase along the life-span of neurotypical participants but would be reduced in autistic ones. Although we found more attentional failures (i.e., wrong behavioural rule switches) in autistic children/teenagers and more perseverative behaviours in autistic young/older adults, only autistic children and older adults exhibited a lower performance (i.e., fewer consecutive correct rule switches) than matched control groups. Overall, our results corroborate the idea that the reduced use of inner speech could represent a disadvantage for autistic children and autistic older adults. Moreover, the results suggest that cognitive-behavioural therapies should focus on developing inner speech skills in autistic children as this could provide cognitive support throughout their whole life span.

JOUR ,,,,,"The inhibition characteristics of Trizma for corrosion of steel in 1 M HCl was investigated using the weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques and the surface techniques XRD,SEM and EDX.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results showed an increase in Rct values and decrease in the value of Cdl with increasing the concentration of Trizma indicating that the presence of Trizma in the solution retards the steel corrosion due to the adsorption of its molecules at the steel/solution interface. The XRD and SEM results indicated that the surface of the steel contains Trizma molecules. The DFT method was investigated to correlate the molecular properties of the studied Trizma with the experimental inhibition efficiency. Langmuir, Flory–Huggins isotherm, and the Kinetic–thermodynamic model were used to fit the corrosion inhibition data of Trizma. The results indicated that the Langmuir isotherm does not fit with the experimental results due mainly to the non-ideal adsorption of its molecules at the steel/solution interface.

In particular, this study examined the extent to which measured items are inferable by theoretically related items, as well as the extent to which the information carried by a given construct can be translated into other theoretically compatible normative scales based on other constructs (thereby providing information about construct validity); as well as the replicability of clinical decision rules on several partitions (thereby providing information about criterion validity).

JOUR ,,,,,"Multiple measures of decision-making under uncertainty (e.g. jumping to conclusions (JTC), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), win-switch behavior, random exploration) have been associated with delusional thinking in independent studies. Yet, it is unknown whether these variables explain shared or unique variance in delusional thinking, and whether these relationships are specific to paranoia or delusional ideation more broadly. Additionally, the underlying computational mechanisms require further investigation. To investigate these questions, task and self-report data were collected in 88 individuals (46 healthy controls, 42 schizophrenia-spectrum) and included measures of cognitive biases and behavior on probabilistic reversal learning and explore/exploit tasks. Of those, only win-switch rate significantly differed between groups. In regression, reversal learning performance, random exploration, and poor evidence integration during BADE showed significant, independent associations with paranoia. Only self-reported JTC was associated with delusional ideation, controlling for paranoia. Computational parameters increased the proportion of variance explained in paranoia. Overall, decision-making influenced by strong volatility and variability is specifically associated with paranoia, whereas self-reported hasty decision-making is specifically associated with other themes of delusional ideation. These aspects of decision-making under uncertainty may therefore represent distinct cognitive processes that, together, have the potential to worsen delusional thinking across the psychosis spectrum.

JOUR ,,,,,"Creativity has traditionally been considered an ability exclusive to human beings. However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in generative AI chatbots that can produce high-quality artworks, raising questions about the differences between human and machine creativity. In this study, we compared the creativity of humans (n = 256) with that of three current AI chatbots using the alternate uses task (AUT), which is the most used divergent thinking task. Participants were asked to generate uncommon and creative uses for everyday objects. On average, the AI chatbots outperformed human participants. While human responses included poor-quality ideas, the chatbots generally produced more creative responses. However, the best human ideas still matched or exceed those of the chatbots. While this study highlights the potential of AI as a tool to enhance creativity, it also underscores the unique and complex nature of human creativity that may be difficult to fully replicate or surpass with AI technology. The study provides insights into the relationship between human and machine creativity, which is related to important questions about the future of creative work in the age of AI.

JOUR ,,,,,"Network analysis is gaining momentum as an accepted practice to identify which factors in causal loop diagrams (CLDs)—mental models that graphically represent causal relationships between a system’s factors—are most likely to shift system-level behaviour, known as leverage points. This application of network analysis, employed to quantitatively identify leverage points without having to use computational modelling approaches that translate CLDs into sets of mathematical equations, has however not been duly reflected upon. We evaluate whether using commonly applied network analysis metrics to identify leverage points is justified, focusing on betweenness- and closeness centrality. First, we assess whether the metrics identify the same leverage points based on CLDs that represent the same system but differ in inferred causal structure—finding that they provide unreliable results. Second, we consider conflicts between assumptions underlying the metrics and CLDs. We recognise six conflicts suggesting that the metrics are not equipped to take key information captured in CLDs into account. In conclusion, using betweenness- and closeness centrality to identify leverage points based on CLDs is at best premature and at worst incorrect—possibly causing erroneous identification of leverage points. This is problematic as, in current practice, the results can inform policy recommendations. Other quantitative or qualitative approaches that better correspond with the system dynamics perspective must be explored. ",,,"Sloot, Peter M. A.

This theory proposes that expert tennis players should position themselves on the bisector of the angle of the opponent’s possibilities in order to optimize shot return, suggesting a geometric occupation of the court relative to the opponent's affordances; namely what he/she is capable of doing. We tested this hypothesis by analysing player and ball positioning data from professional tennis matches recorded with a Hawk-Eye system. We compared this hypothesis with two alternative computational and probabilistic hypotheses which would consist in positioning oneself on the average or the median of the shots usually played from a given location. The results show that expert tennis players apply the principles of the theory of angles and thus confirm Henri Cochet's intuition. That is, for lateral court positioning, a geometric strategy is deemed optimal by expert players. It also appears that the more experienced the players are, the more precise their application of this strategy becomes. ",,,"Murphy, Colm P.

Here, the Circular Inference model was used to capture associations between changes in perceptual inference and the dynamics of conspiracy ideations in times of uncertainty. A bistable perception task and conspiracy belief assessment focused on major sociopolitical events were administered to large populations from three polarized countries. We show that when uncertainty peaks, an overweighting of sensory information is associated with conspiracy ideations. Progressively, this exploration strategy gives way to an exploitation strategy in which increased adherence to conspiracy theories is associated with the amplification of prior information.

JOUR ,,,,,"Environmental art design (EAD) has recently encouraged creative thinking by investigating novel materials, technologies, and techniques for designing environmental art that advances sustainability. EAD faces challenges in integrating novel materials and technologies while promoting sustainability. Environmental art design is targeted at human living areas; here, adequate and excessive utilization of resources is minimized, and the social and natural environments are utilized aesthetically. Aesthetic excellence in environmental art design, along with growing technological accomplishments and cultural heritage, is concentrated on meeting the demands of human aesthetic pursuits in the new era, which lacks earlier techniques. Hence, an algorithm named environmental art design using fuzzy (EADF) to evaluate the environmental criteria for better decision-making is introduced. Initially, a fuzzy-based technique for order preference similar to the ideal solution (FTOPSIS), which considers multiple variables such as visual appeal, environmental impact, sustainability, and audience involvement in the community, was employed in the design process. Environmental art designers utilize fuzzy TOPSIS to assess works of art using several criteria. It seeks to make accurate decisions and accomplish desirable creative effects by considering ambiguity and subjectivity. The approach utilizes fuzzy variable entropy analysis to determine questionable attribute weightings and employs triangular fuzzy numbers to represent criteria and analyze preference values. Artworks are evaluated for deviation from ideal results using the Euclidean distance measure, enabling logical ranking evaluation and comparison. The EADF model outperforms the other models when considering different input factors. EADF excels in color (83.74), composition (82.37), emotion (85.61), contrast (97.52), clarity (98.16), harmony (95.49), and sensitivity (96.44) when evaluated in environmental art design, showcasing its usefulness. This work has implications for directing artists, designers, and decision-makers toward environmentally sustainable and artistically impactful art practices. Hence, the performance of this EADF model is validated using audience involvement, environmental impact, sustainability, and a visual appeal score.

JOUR ,,,,,"Visual Transformers(ViT) have made remarkable achievements in the field of medical image analysis. However, ViT-based methods have poor classification results on some small-scale medical image classification datasets. Meanwhile, many ViT-based models sacrifice computational cost for superior performance, which is a great challenge in practical clinical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient medical image classification network based on an alternating mixture of CNN and Transformer tandem, which is called Eff-CTNet. Specifically, the existing ViT-based method still mainly relies on multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Among them, the attention maps of MHSA are highly similar, which leads to computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a group cascade attention (GCA) module to split the feature maps, which are provided to different attention heads to further improves the diversity of attention and reduce the computational cost. In addition, we propose an efficient CNN (EC) module to enhance the ability of the model and extract the local detail information in medical images. Finally, we connect them and design an efficient hybrid medical image classification network, namely Eff-CTNet. Extensive experimental results show that our Eff-CTNet achieves advanced classification performance with less computational cost on three public medical image classification datasets.

We built on prior work based on the Social Evaluation Learning Task (SELT) and introduced a new computational model to better explain rapid initial inferences and progressive refinement during serial social evaluations. The Social Evaluation Learning Task-Revised (SELT-R) was improved by stakeholder input, making it more engaging and suitable for adolescents. A sample of 130 adults from the UK completed the SELT-R and questionnaires assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety. ‘Classify-refine’ computational models were compared with previously successful Bayesian models. The ‘classify-refine’ models performed better, providing insight into how people infer the attributes and motives of others. Parameters of the best fitting model from the SELT-R were correlated with Anxiety factor scores, with higher symptoms associated with greater decision noise and higher (less flexible) policy certainty.

JOUR ,,,,,"Under the background of engineering education professional certification, the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) education concept of “output-oriented” has been paid more and more attention. The traditional experimental teaching of programming course often focuses on the teaching of theoretical knowledge, and lacks the cultivation of students’ practical ability and innovative spirit. Engineering education puts forward new requirements for the teaching mode of program design course. The experimental teaching of programming courses requires further reform and innovation to cultivate high-quality technical engineering talents with good social responsibility, teamwork ability, and innovative thinking ability. Guided by the theory of engineering education combined with the educational philosophy of Conceive–Design–Implement–Operate (CDIO) and OBE, this paper carried out the reform of experimental teaching of programming course among students majoring in computer science and technology and information security. This teaching reform aimed to better cultivate students’ practical ability, innovation ability, and knowledge-integrated application ability, considering the course concept, course design, course implementation, and course operation, and exploring the practice of teaching process reconfiguration, teaching content organization, and teaching method integration. This multi-integration experimental teaching reform was found to fully mobilize students’ learning enthusiasm, tap into students’ potential, greatly improve students’ comprehensive practical ability, effectively achieve course goals, and lay a solid foundation for subsequent professional course learning. This teaching mode has been practically applied in current experimental teaching and is widely recognized by students, providing a reference for improving teaching quality.

Study 2 compared people diagnosed with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) to matched controls. The design replicated our previous work showing ketamine-related perturbations in how meta-level confidence maintained behavioural policy. We applied the same computational modelling analysis here, in order to compare the pharmacological model to three groups at different stages of psychosis. Accuracy was reduced in FEP, reflecting increased tendencies to shift strategy following probabilistic errors. The TRS group also showed a greater tendency to shift choice strategies though accuracy levels were not significantly reduced. Applying the previously-used computational modelling approach, we observed that only the TRS group showed altered confidence-based modulation of responding, previously observed under ketamine administration. Overall, our behavioural findings demonstrated resemblance between clinical groups (FEP and TRS) and ketamine in terms of a reduction in stabilisation of responding in a noisy environment. The computational analysis suggested that TRS, but not FEP, replicates ketamine effects but we consider the computational findings preliminary given limitations in performance of the model.

JOUR ,,,,,"Despite the evolutionary history and cultural significance of visual art, the structure of aesthetic experiences it evokes has only attracted recent scientific attention. What kinds of experience does visual art evoke? Guided by Semantic Space Theory, we identify the concepts that most precisely describe people’s aesthetic experiences using new computational techniques. Participants viewed 1457 artworks sampled from diverse cultural and historical traditions and reported on the emotions they felt and their perceived artwork qualities. Results show that aesthetic experiences are high-dimensional, comprising 25 categories of feeling states. Extending well beyond hedonism and broad evaluative judgments (e.g., pleasant/unpleasant), aesthetic experiences involve emotions of daily social living (e.g., “sad”, “joy”), the imagination (e.g., “psychedelic”, “mysterious”), profundity (e.g., “disgust”, “awe”), and perceptual qualities attributed to the artwork (e.g., “whimsical”, “disorienting”). Aesthetic emotions and perceptual qualities jointly predict viewers’ liking of the artworks, indicating that we conceptualize aesthetic experiences in terms of the emotions we feel but also the qualities we perceive in the artwork. Aesthetic experiences are often mixed and lie along continuous gradients between categories rather than within discrete clusters. Our collection of artworks is visualized within an interactive map (https://barradeau.com/2021/emotions-map/), revealing the high-dimensional space of aesthetic experiences associated with visual art.

In addition to demonstrating high classification accuracy (median AUC: 0.996) at distinguishing meditation from thinking states moment by moment, IDI can accurately stratify meditator cohorts by experience, and correctly identify the practices most effective at training the dereification aspect of meditation (decentering from immersion with thoughts and perceptions and recognizing them as mental constructs). These results suggest that IDI models may be a useful real-time proxy for dereification and meditation progress, requiring only 1 min of mind wandering data (and no meditation data) during model training.

JOUR ,,,,,"Between 2020 and 2022, lockdown and restraining measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in daily routines and also in language usage. At certain points during the pandemic, populations in some countries were unwilling or unlikely to respond to government messages, either because of the tone and analytic discourse used by leaders, or because they did not understand the messages. Linguistic markers and meanings were therefore linked to low levels of engagement, negative emotions and high levels of analytical thinking, especially in relation to the discourses of influential international leaders. We subjected sixteen speeches by eight country leaders to topic modelling and sentiment analysis in order to understand how the psychological functions of language were affected during two different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this topic analysis we organize 39,073 words collected from sixteen authentic speeches delivered in two different periods of the acute phase of the pandemic. These were encoded in the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count program (LIWC), with the main aim being to identify differences between the periods. We examined the following aspects: (1) the emotional tone, analytical thinking and clout (empathy dimension); (2) the changes in these three dimensions or factors between periods 1 and 2 (February and May 2020). We observed a negative relationship between emotional tone and analytical thinking and a positive relationship between clout and emotional tone. When we considered the changes in pandemic circumstances, the psycholinguistic profiles of eight country leaders demonstrated fluctuations in language and emotions. Further reviews and research should focus on the current language and deficit wording of this population (leaders).

Future-oriented cognition, such as frequent prospective future thinking in daily life, promotes farsighted decision making. However, whether temporal orientation is altered in anorexia nervosa, potentially contributing to reduced delay discounting in this population, remains unclear. We measured delay discounting behavior, anorexia nervosa symptomatology, and temporal orientation in a large sample of never-diagnosed individuals. We found that higher anorexia nervosa symptomatology was associated with reduced delay discounting. Anorexia nervosa symptoms were also correlated with increased future-oriented cognition. Moreover, future-oriented cognition mediated the difference in delay-discounting behavior between high and low anorexia nervosa symptom groups. These results were unrelated to subjective time perception and independent of mood and anxiety symptomatology.

JOUR ,,,,,"Many workers today engage in straightforward judgment tasks, increasing the need for interventions to improve accuracy. We propose a resource-rational and psychohygienic intervention, “wait short time”, which introduces a brief pause before displaying alternatives. This pause works as a harmonious triad: it clears the mind of prior judgment bias, restores present attention, and prepares the mind for future judgments; and all this without additional instructions. Based on a resource rationality framework, cognitive costs (e.g., irritation, cognitive conflict) are associated with prolonged thinking because of humans limited cognitive resources. Therefore, there should be an appropriately short thinking time to achieve higher accuracy with minimal workload. We investigated the effectiveness of the proposed intervention both theoretically and empirically. The computer simulations demonstrated that, under assumptions of limited cognitive resources, there was an optimal time at the early stages for maximizing total benefits. The results of behavioral experiment was consistent with the theoretical findings: Providing a waiting time (1 s or 2.5 s) improved judgment accuracy, but cognitive conflicts increased over time and an unnecessarily long time (2.5 s) induced more subjective irritation. Consequently, an appropriate time (1 s) could enhance judgment accuracy with less workload. We discuss the implications and limitations of the proposed intervention.

JOUR ,,,,,"In cybersecurity, anomaly detection in tabular data is essential for ensuring information security. While traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have shown some success, they continue to face significant challenges in terms of generalization. To address these limitations, this paper presents an innovative method for tabular data anomaly detection based on large language models, called “Tabular Anomaly Detection via Guided Prompts” (TAD-GP). This approach utilizes a 7-billion-parameter open-source model and incorporates strategies such as data sample introduction, anomaly type recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning, multi-turn dialogue, and key information reinforcement. Experimental results indicate that the TAD-GP framework improves F1 scores by 79.31%, 97.96%, and 59.09% on the CICIDS2017, KDD Cup 1999, and UNSW-NB15 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the smaller-scale TAD-GP model outperforms larger models across multiple datasets, demonstrating its practical potential in environments with constrained computational resources and requirements for private deployment. This method addresses a critical gap in research on anomaly detection in cybersecurity, specifically using small-scale open-source models.

JOUR ,,,,,"From computer vision to protein fold prediction, Language Models (LMs) have proven successful in transferring their representation of sequential data to a broad spectrum of tasks beyond the domain of natural language processing. Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology naturally fits to transformer-based architectures. In a pre-processing step analogous to text tokenization, large microscopy images are tessellated into smaller image patches. However, due to the massive size of WSIs comprising thousands of such patches, the problem of WSI classification has not been addressed via deep transformer architectures, let alone via available text-pre-trained deep transformer language models. We introduce SeqShort, a multi-head attention-based sequence shortening layer that summarizes a large WSI into a fixed- and short-sized sequence of feature vectors by removing redundant visual information. Our sequence shortening mechanism not only reduces the computational costs of self-attention on large inputs, it also allows to include standard positional encodings to the previously unordered bag of patches that compose a WSI. We use SeqShort to effectively classify WSIs in different digital pathology tasks using a deep, text pre-trained transformer model while fine-tuning less than 0.1% of its parameters, demonstrating that their knowledge about natural language transfers well to this domain.

In fact, information has always played a pivotal role; however, that role is, as the years of history accumulate, becoming even more significant. It is, therefore, a pursuit of scientific inquiry to quantify the functionality and semantics of information—this is also the goal of the article one reads. We have constructively and critically reviewed state-of-the-art approaches, presented challenges, and suggested a new approach that deals with the issues of information quantification. The developed approach represents a method for general quantification of functional information, including the total functional information of a system and the semantics revealed by functionality. Such a general method can potentially have significance far beyond the shores of information quantification, especially considering the importance of information in computer and information science, quantum physics, and chemistry. We have also made first steps of placing functional information in a computational complexity framework, which will potentially foster algorithmics around it, especially in terms of optimality or degeneracy, and possibly even in terms of work around classes of computational complexity.

JOUR ,,,,,"Flexible goal-directed human cognition is supported by many forms of self-directed manipulation of representations. Among them, Inner-Speech (IS; covert self-directed speech) acts on second-order representations (e.g., goals/sub-goals), empowering attention and feedback processing. Interestingly, patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) show impaired Executive Functions (EF; e.g., cognitive flexibility) and, probably, a related IS alteration. However, fragmentary evidence and no computational modeling prevent a clear assessment of these processes and focused therapeutic interventions. Here, we address these issues by exploiting a translational approach that integrates experimental clinical data, machine learning, and computational modeling. First, we administered the Wisconsin Cards Sorting Test (WCST; a neuropsychological test probing cognitive flexibility) to 162 SSD patients and 108 healthy control participants, and we computed the clinical behavioural data with a data-driven clustering algorithm. Second, we extracted the cluster neuropsychological profiles with our theory-based validated computational model of the WCST. Finally, we exploited our model to emulate an IS-based psychotherapeutic intervention for SSD subpopulations. We identified different SSD sub-populations and global trends (e.g., a descending feedback sensitivity); however, extremely different neuropsychological profiles emerged. In particular, ‘Relatively Intact’ patients showed an unexpected profile (distraction/reasoning failures), quite divergent from the perseverative/rigid profile of the others. Importantly, the former showed no impact of Interfering-IS, while the others showed increased Interfering-IS strongly affecting their cognition. These differences highlight that SSD populations require a cluster-dependent individualisation of the intervention to achieve adequate cognitive performance. Overall, these results support a clear definition of neuropsychological profiles and the related Interfering-IS impact in SSD subpopulations, thus showing important implications for basic research (e.g., cognitive neuroscience) and clinical fields (clinical psychology and psychiatry).

Here, we identified the neurocognitive correlates of semantic search components related to creative abilities. We designed an associative fluency task based on polysemous words and distinguished two search components related to clustering and switching between the different meanings of the polysemous words. Clustering correlated with divergent thinking, while switching correlated with the ability to combine remote associates. Furthermore, switching correlated with semantic memory structure and executive abilities, and was predicted by connectivity between the default, control, and salience neural networks. In contrast, clustering relied on interactions between control, salience, and attentional neural networks. Our results suggest that switching captures interactions between memory structure and control processes guiding the search whereas clustering may capture attentional controlled processes for persistent search, and that alternations between exploratory search and focused attention support creativity.

In the present study, we aim to distinguish behavioral and neural bases of novelty and appropriateness of creative idea generation. In alignment with two established theories of creative thinking, which respectively, emphasize semantic association and executive control, behavioral results indicate that novelty relies more on associative abilities, while appropriateness relies more on executive functions. Next, employing a connectome predictive modeling (CPM) approach in resting-state fMRI data, we define two functional network-based models—dominated by interactions within the default network and by interactions within the limbic network—that respectively, predict novelty and appropriateness (i.e., cross-brain prediction). Furthermore, the generalizability and specificity of the two functional connectivity patterns are verified in additional resting-state fMRI and task fMRI.

Computational modeling revealed that smokers under-estimated the influence of their actions and self-reported a reduced sense of control, compared to non-smokers. These findings were replicated in a large independent sample of participants recruited online. Neurally, smokers showed reduced tracking of forward projected choice values in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and impaired computation of social prediction errors in the midbrain.

Despite recent advances, creativity neuroscience lacks a unified framework to model its complexity across neural, genetic, and cognitive scales. Using task-based fMRI from two independent samples and MVPA, we identified a neural pattern that predicts DT, validated through cognitive decoding, genetic data, and large-scale resting-state fMRI. Our findings reveal that DT neural patterns span brain regions associated with diverse cognitive functions, with positive weights in the default mode and frontoparietal control networks and negative weights in the visual network. The high correlation with the primary gradient of functional connectivity suggests that DT involves extensive integration from concrete sensory information to abstract, higher-level cognition, distinguishing it from other advanced cognitive functions. Moreover, neurobiological analyses show that the DT pattern is positively correlated with dopamine-related neurotransmitters and genes influencing neurotransmitter release, advancing the neurobiological understanding of creativity.

Despite the convenience brought by geographic information systems and computer-aided design, determining the layout of land use and roads still heavily relies on human experts. Here we propose an artificial intelligence urban-planning model to generate spatial plans for urban communities. To overcome the difficulty of diverse and irregular urban geography, we construct a graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph. To tackle the challenge of the vast solution space, we develop a reinforcement learning model based on graph neural networks. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world communities demonstrate that our computational model outperforms plans designed by human experts in objective metrics and that it can generate spatial plans responding to different circumstances and needs. We also propose a human–artificial intelligence collaborative workflow of urban planning, in which human designers can substantially benefit from our model to be more productive, generating more efficient spatial plans with much less time.

JOUR ,,,,,"Middle aged adults experience depression and anxiety differently than younger adults. Age may affect life circumstances, depending on accessibility of social connections, jobs, physical health, etc, as these factors influence the prevalence and symptomatology. Depression and anxiety are typically measured using rating scales; however, recent research suggests that such symptoms can be assessed by open-ended questions that are analysed by question-based computational language assessments (QCLA). Here, we study middle aged and younger adults’ responses about their mental health using open-ended questions and rating scales about their mental health. We then analyse their responses with computational methods based on natural language processing (NLP). The results demonstrate that: (1) middle aged adults describe their mental health differently compared to younger adults; (2) where, for example, middle aged adults emphasise depression and loneliness whereas young adults list anxiety and financial concerns; (3) different semantic models are warranted for younger and middle aged adults; (4) compared to young participants, the middle aged participants described their mental health more accurately with words; (5) middle-aged adults have better mental health than younger adults as measured by semantic measures. In conclusion, NLP combined with machine learning methods may provide new opportunities to identify, model, and describe mental health in middle aged and younger adults and could possibly be applied to the older adults in future research.

As a case study, the researchers tracked a carving knife used in a clay-relief technique in two studies, one comprising (i) twelve sessions and five novice participants; and the other (ii) twenty-eight sessions with a single skilled artist.

Failure to effect meaningful changes in this system could see these initiatives not reach their potential and lead to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their marketing campaigns. Systems thinking is often touted as a methodology to manage and effect change; however, there is little practical advice available for decision-makers to include systems thinking insights to work towards Responsible AI. Using the notion of ‘leverage zones’ adapted from the systems thinking literature, we suggest a novel approach to plan for and experiment with potential initiatives and interventions. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Five Ps to help practitioners construct and identify holistic interventions that may work towards Responsible AI, from lower-order interventions such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating parameters, through to higher-order interventions such as redefining the system’s foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in the first place. Finally, we reflect on the framework as a scaffold for transdisciplinary question-asking to improve outcomes towards Responsible AI.

JOUR ,,,,,"The purpose of this article is to present the results of a study conducted on a population of students from two educational institutions in western Mexico. The intention is to identify how students perceive their level of systemic thinking, focusing primarily on women. Thus, this article seeks to identify differences not only on the basis of gender (men–women) but also on the basis of social status (public and private institutions). Methodologically, a descriptive statistical analysis was carried out with which it was possible to conclude that, although statistically significant differences between men and women are not identified, they are found between groups of women in public and private institutions. This article invites reflection on the need to study possible gender gaps from an intersectional perspective, which considers the differences between genders and the various dimensions and relations of women in their educational process.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this paper, we situate our computational approach to philosophy relative to other digital humanities and computational social science practices, based on reflections stemming from our research on the PolyGraphs project in social epistemology. We begin by describing PolyGraphs. An interdisciplinary project funded by the Academies (BA, RS, and RAEng) and the Leverhulme Trust, it uses philosophical simulations (Mayo-Wilson and Zollman, 2021) to study how ignorance prevails in networks of inquiring rational agents. We deploy models developed in economics (Bala and Goyal, 1998), and refined in philosophy (O’Connor and Weatherall, 2018; Zollman, 2007), to simulate communities of agents engaged in inquiry, who generate evidence relevant to the topic of their investigation and share it with their neighbors, updating their beliefs on the evidence available to them. We report some novel results surrounding the prevalence of ignorance in such networks. In the second part of the paper, we compare our own to other related academic practices. We begin by noting that, in digital humanities projects of certain types, the computational component does not appear to directly support the humanities research itself; rather, the digital and the humanities are simply grafted together, not fully intertwined and integrated. PolyGraphs is notably different: the computational work directly supports the investigation of the primary research questions, which themselves belong decidedly within the humanities in general, and philosophy in particular. This suggests an affinity with certain projects in the computational social sciences. But despite these real similarities, there are differences once again: the computational philosophy we practice aims not so much at description and prediction as at answering the normative and interpretive questions that are distinctive of humanities research.

JOUR ,,,,,"Since the days of the transcendentalists, most environmental philosophers have assumed a dividing line between human-made technology and nature. In the context of our current technological world and the contemporary environmental movement, this way of thinking is perhaps more pervasive than ever. But from a cybernetic perspective, nature and technology together represent an inextricably connected network of signals and feedback, continuously developing as an organic whole. Drawing from cultural histories of the interconnectedness of life and of the cyborg concept, I propose CyberGaia as a metaphor to describe our biosphere in a fashion which acknowledges human technology as an integral part of nature. In this framework, humanity and technology represent an inseparable constituent of a larger interconnected system. Though CyberGaia does not distinguish nature and technology at a fundamental level, it recognizes that the technological world influences nature’s development by acting on the network within which it is embedded. By emphasizing the sublime beauty of nature’s interconnectedness, CyberGaia also preserves the spiritual-emotional connection to Earth which has heavily contributed to driving the environmental movement. CyberGaia merges physics and inspiration, encouraging us to create sustainable closed-loop technological systems that enable a flourishing biosphere. I argue that seeing the world as an interconnected cybernetic network may help us to better understand the biosphere in its totality while motivating us to take actions which help protect and preserve CyberGaia’s diverse menagerie of human and nonhuman life.

JOUR ,,,,,"Educational strategies have undergone significant transformations in an era marked by rapid globalization, advancements in communication technologies, and challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid these changes, Citizen Science (CS) has gained prominence as an innovative educational approach, particularly in fostering complex thinking skills necessary to navigate contemporary global trends. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of CS projects in developing complex thinking competencies within higher education. Through a bibliometric analysis of 28 Scopus-indexed articles from 2000 to 2022, this research maps the landscape of CS as an educational strategy and evaluates its alignment with complex thinking development. The analysis indicates a strong link between CS projects and the enhancement of complex thinking and its sub-competencies. It demonstrates that CS initiatives have successfully achieved their educational objectives, substantially enriching the learning experience. Furthermore, the research highlights a growing trend in applying CS for educational purposes. These findings suggest that CS can be a valuable component of higher education curricula, offering a practical method for developing critical competencies in students. The study underscores the potential of CS to contribute meaningfully to the evolution of pedagogical practices and provides a foundation for future research to build upon, particularly in the context of higher education’s response to global educational demands.

JOUR ,,,,,"Audiovisual news is a critical cultural phenomenon that has been influencing audience worldviews for more than a hundred years. To understand historical trends in multimodal audiovisual news, we need to explore them longitudinally using large sets of data. Despite promising developments in film history, computational video analysis, and other relevant fields, current research streams have limitations related to the scope of data used, the systematism of analysis, and the modalities and elements to be studied in audiovisual material and its metadata. Simultaneously, each disciplinary approach contributes significant input to research reducing these limitations. We therefore advocate for combining the strengths of several disciplines. Here we propose a multidisciplinary framework for systematically studying large collections of historical audiovisual news to gain a coherent picture of their temporal dynamics, cultural diversity, and potential societal effects across several quantitative and qualitative dimensions of analysis. By using newsreels as an example of such complex historically formed data, we combine the context crucial to qualitative approaches with the systematicity and ability to cover large amounts of data from quantitative methods. The framework template for historical newsreels is exemplified by a case study of the “News of the Day” newsreel series produced in the Soviet Union during 1944–1992. The proposed framework enables a more nuanced analysis of longitudinal collections of audiovisual news, expanding our understanding of the dynamics of global knowledge cultures.

JOUR ,,,,,"What are the best methods of capturing thematic similarity between literary texts? Knowing the answer to this question would be useful for automatic clustering of book genres, or any other thematic grouping. This paper compares a variety of algorithms for unsupervised learning of thematic similarities between texts, which we call “computational thematics”. These algorithms belong to three steps of analysis: text pre-processing, extraction of text features, and measuring distances between the lists of features. Each of these steps includes a variety of options. We test all the possible combinations of these options. Every combination of algorithms is given a task to cluster a corpus of books belonging to four pre-tagged genres of fiction. This clustering is then validated against the “ground truth” genre labels. Such comparison of algorithms allows us to learn the best and the worst combinations for computational thematic analysis. To illustrate the difference between the best and the worst methods, we then cluster 5000 random novels from the HathiTrust corpus of fiction.

JOUR ,,,,,"Leveraging the synergy between causal knowledge graphs and a large language model (LLM), our study introduces a groundbreaking approach for computational hypothesis generation in psychology. We analyzed 43,312 psychology articles using a LLM to extract causal relation pairs. This analysis produced a specialized causal graph for psychology. Applying link prediction algorithms, we generated 130 potential psychological hypotheses focusing on “well-being”, then compared them against research ideas conceived by doctoral scholars and those produced solely by the LLM. Interestingly, our combined approach of a LLM and causal graphs mirrored the expert-level insights in terms of novelty, clearly surpassing the LLM-only hypotheses (t(59) = 3.34, p = 0.007 and t(59) = 4.32, p < 0.001, respectively). This alignment was further corroborated using deep semantic analysis. Our results show that combining LLM with machine learning techniques such as causal knowledge graphs can revolutionize automated discovery in psychology, extracting novel insights from the extensive literature. This work stands at the crossroads of psychology and artificial intelligence, championing a new enriched paradigm for data-driven hypothesis generation in psychological research.

JOUR ,,,,,"There is growing support and interest in postsecondary interdisciplinary environmental education, which integrates concepts and disciplines in addition to providing varied perspectives. There is a need to assess student learning in these programs as well as rigorous evaluation of educational practices, especially of complex synthesis concepts. This work tests a text classification machine learning model as a tool to assess student systems thinking capabilities using two questions anchored by the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus phenomena by answering two questions (1) Can machine learning models be used to identify instructor-determined important concepts in student responses? (2) What do college students know about the interconnections between food, energy, and water, and how have students assimilated systems thinking into their constructed responses about FEW? Reported here is a broad range of model performances across 26 text classification models associated with two different assessment items, with model accuracy ranging from 0.755 to 0.992. Expert-like responses were infrequent in our dataset compared to responses providing simpler, incomplete explanations of the systems presented in the question. For those students moving from describing individual effects to multiple effects, their reasoning about the mechanism behind the system indicates advanced systems thinking ability. Specifically, students exhibit higher expertise in explaining changing water usage than discussing trade-offs for such changing usage. This research represents one of the first attempts to assess the links between foundational, discipline-specific concepts and systems thinking ability. These text classification approaches to scoring student FEW Nexus Constructed Responses (CR) indicate how these approaches can be used, in addition to several future research priorities for interdisciplinary, practice-based education research. Development of further complex question items using machine learning would allow evaluation of the relationship between foundational concept understanding and integration of those concepts as well as a more nuanced understanding of student comprehension of complex interdisciplinary concepts.

JOUR ,,,,,"The paper proposes a framework that combines behavioral and computational experiments employing fictional prompts as a novel tool for investigating cultural artifacts and social biases in storytelling both by humans and generative AI. The study analyzes 250 stories authored by crowdworkers in June 2019 and 80 stories generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in March 2023 by merging methods from narratology and inferential statistics. Both crowdworkers and large language models responded to identical prompts about creating and falling in love with an artificial human. The proposed experimental paradigm allows a direct and controlled comparison between human and LLM-generated storytelling. Responses to the Pygmalionesque prompts confirm the pervasive presence of the Pygmalion myth in the collective imaginary of both humans and large language models. All solicited narratives present a scientific or technological pursuit. The analysis reveals that narratives from GPT-3.5 and particularly GPT-4 are more progressive in terms of gender roles and sexuality than those written by humans. While AI narratives with default settings and no additional prompting can occasionally provide innovative plot twists, they offer less imaginative scenarios and rhetoric than human-authored texts.

JOUR ,,,,,"At present, collaborative programming is a prevalent approach in programming education, yet its effectiveness often falls short due to the varying levels of coding skills among team members. To address these challenges, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be introduced as a supportive tool to enhance both the efficiency and outcomes of collaborative programming. In this shift, the structure of collaborative teams evolves from human-to-human to a new paradigm consisting of human, human, and AI. To investigate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into collaborative programming, this study designed a quasi-experiment. To explore the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into collaborative programming, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 82 sixth- and seventh-grade students, who were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The results showed that incorporating LLMs into collaborative programming significantly reduced students’ cognitive load and improved their computational thinking skills. However, no significant difference in self-efficacy was observed between the two groups, likely due to the cognitive demand students faced when transitioning from graphical programming to text-based coding. Despite this, the study remains optimistic about the potential of LLM-enhanced collaborative programming, as students learning in this way exhibit lower cognitive load than those in conventional environments.

JOUR ,,,,,"The involvement of multiple social, technical, cultural, and scientific aspects makes domains concerning the human factor inherently complex. For instance, work stress, with its dynamic nature and ambiguous boundaries, falls under what is referred to as a complex informal structured domain (CISD).

However, implementing such cognitive solutions in computer science within these domains presents a significant challenge. This article thoroughly explores and analyzes three empirical-theoretical approaches to conceptualize and specify cognitive solutions for real-world problems in CISD. These approaches involve a literature review on the use of specific machine learning artificial intelligence techniques to build work stress prevention models, employing cognitive solutions like ontologies, and integrating a systemic methodological framework for conceptualization and specification. This exploration underscores the necessity for a methodological model that effectively supports the conceptualization and specification of cognitive solutions in CISD.

JOUR ,,,,,"Puberty is a phase in which individuals often test the boundaries of themselves and surrounding others and further define their identity – and thus their uniqueness compared to other individuals. Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS) grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring disciplines to achieve scientific rigor and refine its identity. However, there are certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientific practices from other fields, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the paper suggests that CSS would benefit from integrating practices and knowledge from other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding, and open science practices. Based on this argument, the paper provides ten recommendations for CSS to mature as an interdisciplinary field of research.

JOUR ,,,,,"In this essay, we aim to illustrate how Martin Karplus and his research group effectively set in motion the engine of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecules. This process saw its prodromes between 1969 and the early 1970s with Karplus’ landing in biology, a transition that came to fruition with the treatment of 11-cis-retinal photoisomerization and the development of an allosteric model to account for the mechanism of cooperativity in hemoglobin. In 1977, J. Andrew McCammon, Bruce Gelin, and Martin Karplus published an article in Nature reporting the MD simulation of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). This publication helped initiate the merger of computational statistical mechanics and biochemistry, a process that Karplus undertook at a later stage and whose beginnings we propose to reconstruct in this article through unpublished accounts of the key people who participated in this endeavor.

JOUR ,,,,,"REINFORCE (Research Infrastructures FOR Citizens in Europe) is a Research & Innovation Project, supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 SwafS, ‘Science with and for Society’ work programme (GA872859). The project, which ran from December, 2019, to November, 2022, engaged the public in a variety of innovative ways. Four citizen-science demonstrator projects were developed on the world-leading Zooniverse platform, each focussing on a different area of frontier physics: gravitational waves; neutrino astronomy; particle physics; and muography. A range of art and science events were launched and undertaken. A data-sonification tool—sonoUno—was developed in order to improve the accessibility of the data used in the four demonstrator projects. A course on critical thinking and a history of the Second Scientific Revolution was provided on YouTube and in podcast form, while a senior-citizen-science course was designed, co-developed and implemented. These initiatives were supported by a detailed engagement plan, a dedicated communications and dissemination strategy, and a constantly evolving assessment and evaluation approach. The experiences garnered during the project, in conjunction with consultations with project participants, volunteers and stakeholders, were built into the form of a policy roadmap explaining how to integrate citizen science into research infrastructures in Europe. The roadmap identifies a series of policy objectives and related policy gaps, associated challenges and lays out a series of recommendations. This article describes the results of the REINFORCE project and draws together the experiences of each of the involved twelve partner organisations.

JOUR ,,,,,"Research on exploring the relationship between computational thinking and domain specific knowledge gains (i.e. biological evolution) are becoming more common in science education research. The mechanisms behind these relationships are not well understood, particularly between computational practices and biological evolution content knowledge. Increased computational complexity (i.e. simple to complex) may support a greater comprehension of scales or levels of biological organization (i.e. micro to macro) within the context of biological evolution learning. We made use of quantitative methods from qualitative work in the form of coding and relational analysis to identify which biological levels of organization students addressed, how students made connections between these levels and the level of computational complexity displayed during evolution learning with the use of two computational interventions. The aim of this study was not only exploring the biological levels and biological level connections made during the computational thinking interventions, but also analysis of the differences between these two interventions. The results illuminated that use of specific biological levels, biological level connections and differences in computational complexity were distinguishable and there were significant differences between the interventions. These factors may contribute to better understanding of biological evolution knowledge gains.

JOUR ,,,,,"A meditative ‘technique’ is conceived as a continuum of different affective states involving mind and body jointly. Meditative practices can involve cognitive effort (e.g., focused attention and open-minded techniques), as well as automatic and implicit practices (e.g., transcendental techniques). The NGALSO tantric self-healing meditation technique is a brief, comprehensive meditation technique relying on mind and body connection. In this study, we aimed to investigate the state and the trait neurophysiological correlates of NGALSO meditation practice. First, 19 EEG channels and a 3-lead ECG signal were recorded from 10 expert meditators (more than 7 years of daily meditation) and 10 healthy inexpert participants (controls) who underwent the same meditative procedure. The neuropsychological profiles of experts and controls were compared. Results showed that expert meditators had significantly higher power spectra on alpha, theta and beta, and a higher sympathetic tone with lower parasympathetic tone after meditation. Conversely, the control group had significantly less power spectra on alpha, theta and beta, and a higher parasympathetic tone with lower sympathetic tone after meditation. A machine learning approach also allowed us to classify experts vs. controls correctly by using only EEG Theta bands before or after meditation. ECG results allowed us to show a significantly higher effort by expert meditators vs. controls, thus suggesting that a higher effort is required for this meditation, in line with the principle ‘no pain, no gain’ in body and mind.

JOUR ,,,,,"With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, more and more computational models for generating new molecules are being developed. However, we are often confronted with the question of whether these compounds are easy or difficult to synthesize, which refers to synthetic accessibility of compounds. In this study, a deep learning based computational model called DeepSA, was proposed to predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds, which provides a useful tool to choose molecules. DeepSA is a chemical language model that was developed by training on a dataset of 3,593,053 molecules using various natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, offering advantages over state-of-the-art methods and having a much higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), i.e., 89.6%, in discriminating those molecules that are difficult to synthesize. This helps users select less expensive molecules for synthesis, reducing the time and cost required for drug discovery and development. Interestingly, a comparison of DeepSA with a Graph Attention-based method shows that using SMILES alone can also efficiently visualize and extract compound’s informative features.

JOUR ,,,,,"The objective is to present a proposal for a gender-sensitive risk analysis model using artificial intelligence (AI) within the framework of complex thinking that provides access to opportunities, specifically for vulnerable populations such as women from underprivileged sections. This international non-parametric study highlights the vulnerability of this population in Mexico through a sample of 2787 women. The methodological design included data analysis, the postulation of a proposed model, and a validation method for the credit risk analysis model. There is a correlation between the level of schooling of impoverished and vulnerable women with the possibility of self-employment and selling a product or service. In the framework of complex thinking, the perception of innovative thinking is related to the level of education and innovative decision-making in professional projects. Women with a higher level of schooling tend to think about their professional projects systematically. Promoting complex thinking involves innovative educational practices to encourage critical, systemic, scientific, and innovative thinking in entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Integrating reasoning for complexity benefits women and contributes to economic and social growth in vulnerable regions. In contrast to other models, our credit risk analysis model uses AI and variables for gender, vulnerability, and complex thinking to detect patterns in women's behaviors and attitudes in the venture start-up process. Our proposal is the starting point of many analyses to develop further about artificial intelligence based on complex thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper describes the design, implementation and research of the Cyber Sleuth Science Lab (CSSL), an innovative educational program and supporting virtual learning environment, that combines pedagogical theory, gender inclusive instruction strategies, scientific principles/practices, gamification methods, computational thinking, and real-world problem solving. This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional “outside of the computer” activities to strengthen students’ engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis,including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys’ engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls’ motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity.

Mainly, the effect of IVR on learning outcomes has been the focus. However, far too little attention has been paid to the influence of game elements and IVR features on learners’ perceived cognition. This study examined the relationship between game elements (challenge, goal clarity, and feedback) as pedagogical approach, features of IVR technology (immersion and interaction), and learners’ perceived cognition (reflective thinking and comprehension). An experiment was conducted with 49 undergraduate students who played an IVR game-based application (iThinkSmart) containing mini games developed to facilitate learners’ computational thinking competency. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to investigate the effect of educational game elements and learning contents on learner’s cognition. Findings show that goal clarity is the main predictor of learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension in an educational game-based IVR application. It was also confirmed that immersion and interaction experience impact learner’s comprehension. Notably, adequate learning content in terms of the organisation and relevance of the content contained in an IVR game-based application significantly moderate learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension. The findings of this study have implications for educators and developers of IVR game-based intervention to facilitate learning in the higher education context. In particular, the implication of this study touches on the aspect of learners’ cognitive factors that aim to produce 21st-century problem-solving skills through critical thinking.

JOUR ,,,,,"In recent years, programming education has gained recognition at various educational levels due to its increasing importance. As the need for problem-solving skills becomes more vital, researchers have emphasized the significance of developing algorithmic thinking (AT) skills to help students in program development and error debugging. Despite the development of various text-based and block-based programming tools aimed at improving students’ AT, emerging evidence in the literature indicates insufficient AT skills among students. This study was conducted to understand the growth trajectory of students’ AT skills in different programming environments. The study utilized a multigroup experiment involving 240 programming students randomly assigned to three groups: a text-and-block-based group, a block-based-only group, and a text-based-only group. Students in the text-and-block-based group were exposed to Alice and Python; those in the block-based-only group were exposed to Alice; and those in the text-based-only group were exposed to Python. We found that participants’ growth trajectory in AT skills is linear, with a significant growth rate. Although between-person variability exists across groups, we observed a compensatory effect in the text-and-block-based and block-based-only groups. Additionally, we found significant differences in AT skills across the groups, with no evidence of a gender effect. Our findings suggest that combining text-based and block-based programming environments can lead to improved and sustained intra-individual problem-solving skills, particularly in the field of programming.

JOUR ,,,,,"The rapid advancement of digital technology has not only affected the world of work but also students' learning. Digital learning competence (DLC) is one of the essential skills students need for effective learning in a digital environment. Despite the significant presence of secondary vocational school students in China, constituting one-third of the high school demographic, research on their digital learning needs remains sparse. Addressing this gap, this paper attempted to propose the elements and structural model of digital learning competence for secondary vocational school students (V-DLC). A corresponding questionnaire was compiled, and an analysis was carried out with 872 valid survey data of secondary vocational school students achieved by convenient sampling. A five-factor model for the V-DLC was established through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, cross-validity, and criterion validity tests. This paper suggests that evaluating students' digital learning competence in secondary vocational schools can be achieved by considering the dimensions of cognitive processing and reading, technology use, thinking skills, activity management, and will management, combined with students' learning experiences in school and other fields. Given the global focus on digital learning competence, this framework will pave the way for empirical research on digital learning and guide the enhancement of student learning ability in vocational settings, adapting to the digital era. Furthermore, transitioning to a digitalized vocational education system is essential for preparing students for a digitally-driven workforce, aligning with modern job market demands and global trends.

JOUR ,,,,,"Learning interaction patterns is key to the explanation of learning outcomes. Different studies have reported the relationship between classroom process variables and learning outcomes in a traditional classroom setting. However, the advent of robotics and its attendant student–robot interaction moderated by students’ mathematical ability is yet to be widely discussed empirically. This constitutes the major reason why the study investigated the effects of student–robot interaction and mathematical ability on students' learning outcomes, particularly among Nigerian high school students where the robotics curriculum is at the early stage of implementation. The study was anchored on engagement theory. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential Quant-dominant approach was adopted. A total of 327 high school students who have been exposed to robotic lessons from the year 2021 including robotics subject teachers and learning managers were sampled for the study. Data collected was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics alongside thematic analysis for qualitative data. It was found that mathematical ability could not moderate the relationship between student–robot interaction and learning outcomes (behavioural: β = − 0.001, t = 0.028, p > 0.05, Affective: β = 0.105, t = 0.316, p > 0.05, cognitive engagements: β = − 0.08, t = 0.316, p > 0.05). Affective engagements have a significant influence on critical thinking (β = .126, t = 3.19, p < 0.05) while both affective (β = 0.28, t = 5.63, p < 0.05) and cognitive (β = .17, t = 4.65, p < 0.05) engagements could predict students’ problem-solving. The conclusion was made that learning robotics is a potential instrument to develop students who can think critically to solve some long-standing problems in society. Furthermore, the process requires a lot of affective and cognitive engagement of the students, and in this regard, both parents and teachers have a role to play in offering support to students.

JOUR ,,,,,"This paper explores the evolving landscape of informatics education in European primary and secondary schools, analysing academic and grey literature to define the state of play and open questions related to ‘high-quality informatics education’. It underlines the strategic importance of promoting high-quality informatics education to prepare students for life and work in the digital era, contributing to European societies and economies’ social and economic resilience. Drawing on a review of over 180 recent academic publications, policy documents, and grey literature, it provides an overview of how informatics education is being implemented across Europe and beyond, highlighting recent curricular developments, pedagogical practices, and policy initiatives. The paper also identifies and analyses key open issues related to high-quality informatics education, organised into four clusters: student-related (e.g., equity and inclusion), teacher-related (e.g., professional development, shortage of qualified teachers), school-related (e.g., the need for whole-school approach) and curriculum- and resource-related (e.g., competing curriculum priorities, quality of teaching and learning materials). Finally, the paper offers recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners (school leaders and educators) related to the key open issues of high-quality K-12 informatics education. Overall, the paper contributes to the discussion on high-quality informatics K-12 education in Europe towards identifying and addressing major challenges for equitable access to quality informatics education for all European K-12 students.

Though previous works have proposed different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly, there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other tasks related to problem-solving.

JOUR ,,,,,"Contemporary science is a field that is becoming increasingly computational. Today’s scientists not only leverage computational tools to conduct their investigations, they often must contribute to the design of the computational tools for their specific research. From a science education perspective, for students to learn authentic science practices, students must learn to use the tools of the trade. This necessity in science education has shaped recent K–12 science standards including the Next Generation Science Standards, which explicitly mention the use of computational tools and simulations. These standards, in particular, have gone further and mandated that computational thinking be taught and leveraged as a practice of science. While computational thinking is not a new term, its inclusion in K–12 science standards has led to confusion about what the term means in the context of science learning and to questions about how to differentiate computational thinking from other commonly taught cognitive skills in science like problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, and critical thinking. In this paper, we propose a definition of computational thinking for science (CT-S) and a framework for its operationalization in K–12 science education. We situate our definition and framework in Activity Theory, from the learning sciences, in order to position computational thinking as an input to and outcome of science learning that is mediated by computational tools.

JOUR ,,,,,"There has been substantial research undertaken on the integration of computational thinking (CT) in K-12 mathematics education in recent years, particularly since 2018 when relevant systematic reviews were conducted on the topic. Many empirical studies in this area have yet to elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from 2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized programming and student-centered instructional approaches were facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover, CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2) applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3) generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12 contexts.

This experience can create tensions in the priorities of learning and assessment given the presence of other foundational mathematics content domains such as numbers, algebra, measurement, and geometry. There is a need to study data literacy in comparison to these other content domains in elementary mathematics. To address this need, we developed a methodology motivated by thinking curriculum theory and aligned with international assessment framework, for comparative analysis across mathematics content domains. This methodology examined increasing levels of cognitive domains from knowing to applying to reasoning across mathematics content domains.

Thus, it describes facilitation practices in a holistic way, capturing the way purposes, perspectives, noticing, interpreting, and actions are intertwined and working together to characterize different LA actions. In terms of how perspectives influence actions, eliciting and advancing moves can be enacted either in authoritative ways, driven by one perspective that has authority, or in dialogic ways, driven by multiple perspectives.

However, current evidence of the effectiveness of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills has been inconsistent. To understand the potential of unplugged activities on computational thinking skills, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Our review of 49 studies examined the influence of unplugged activities to improve students’ CT skills in K–12 education between 2006 and 2022. The literature review showed that studies on CT skills were mainly (81.64%) conducted in computer science and STEM education, with board and card games being the most common unplugged activities for fostering CT skills in K–12 education. CT diagnostic tools (36.37%) were frequently used as assessment tools. A follow-up meta-analysis of 13 studies with 16 effect sizes showed a generally large overall effect size (Hedges’s g = 1.028, 95% CI [0.641, 1.415], p < 0.001) for the use of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills. The analysis of several moderator variables (i.e., grade level, class size, intervention duration, and learning tools) and their possible effects on CT skills indicated that unplugged activities are a promising instructional strategy for enhancing students’ CT skills. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of unplugged pedagogy for promoting CT skills in K–12 education. Recommendations for policies, practice, and research are provided accordingly.

JOUR ,,,,,"The drift diffusion model (DDM) is a widely applied computational model of decision making that allows differentiation between latent cognitive and residual processes. One main assumption of the DDM that has undergone little empirical testing is the level of independence between cognitive and motor responses. If true, widespread incorporation of DDM estimation into applied and clinical settings could ease assessment of whether response disruption occurs due to cognitive or motor slowing. Across two experiments, we manipulated response force (motor speed) and set size to evaluate whether drift rates are independent of motor slowing or if motor slowing impacts the drift rate parameter. The hierarchical Bayesian drift diffusion model was used to quantify parameter estimates of drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time. Model comparison revealed changes in set size impacted the drift rate while changes in response force did not impact the drift rate, validating independence between drift rates and motor speed. Convergent validity between parameter estimates and traditional assessments of processing speed and motor function were weak or absent. Widespread application, including neurocognitive assessment where confounded changes in cognitive and motor slowing are pervasive, may provide a more process-pure measurement of information processing speed, leading to advanced disease-symptom management.

JOUR ,,,,,"Computational thinking is the capacity of undertaking a problem-solving process in various disciplines (including STEM, i.e. science, technology, engineering and mathematics) using distinctive techniques that are typical of computer science. It is nowadays considered a fundamental skill for students and citizens, that has the potential to affect future generations. At the roots of computational-thinking abilities stands the knowledge of computer programming, i.e. coding. With the goal of fostering computational thinking in young students, we address the challenging and open problem of using methods, tools and techniques to support teaching and learning of computer-programming skills in school curricula of the secondary grade and university courses. This problem is made complex by several factors. In fact, coding requires abstraction capabilities and complex cognitive skills such as procedural and conditional reasoning, planning, and analogical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm called ACME (“Code Animation by Evolved Metaphors”) that stands at the foundation of the Diogene-CT code visualization environment and methodology.

Based on the metaphors, we introduce a playground architecture to support teaching and learning of the principles of coding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable code visualization tool using consistent metaphors in the field of the Computing Education Research (CER).

JOUR ,,,,,"In this work, BEAM robotics is proposed to enhance the STEM knowledge and skills of engineering students in the electrical, electronic, and mechanical domains. To evaluate the proposal, a course is designed and implemented based on a curriculum with objectives and learning activities centered on the design, construction, and operation of the BEAM robots. In addition, the connection between this proposal and computational thinking is explored. Students learn to recognize each part of robots and how they are related, abstract useful information from an electronic scheme and concretize it in a machine by systematizing their behavior. In addition, thanks to an evaluation of the behavior of the robot, identify the faults and apply the solution, as in the debugging process carried out in software programming. It should be added that BEAM robotics has a sustainable and low-cost aspect, which is used in learning activities where Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is recycled, and students are taught to value and integrate these parts into the design of the robots. A pre and post survey and a respective statistical analysis and evaluation of curricular activities are presented as evidence of the improvement observed in students’ STEM knowledge and skills. In general, the results show that this new teaching tool can promote the STEM curriculum in engineering students and motivate implementation, as a new educational robot, at other academic levels such as secondary and pre-secondary education.

This study explores the relationship between computational thinking and learning satisfaction for non-STEM-major college students. A conceptual model is proposed to examine the structural relationships among computational thinking, self-efficacy, self-exploration, enjoyment and learning satisfaction in an AppInventor-based liberal education course. Collecting data from 190 undergraduate students from Taiwan and analyzing the data by using partial least squares (PLS) methods, the research framework confirms the six proposed hypotheses. These results show that both computational thinking and enjoyment play significant roles in both self-exploration and digital self-efficacy. Moreover, digital self-efficacy and self-exploration also have a significant positive influence on learning satisfaction. These findings have implications for influencing the learning outcomes of non-STEM-major college students, computational thinking course instructors, and computational thinking relevant policies.

JOUR ,,,,,"This work addresses from the perspective of evolutionary pressure, the delicate issue of the mechanisms and causes that are behind the emergence of the faculty of language among early Homo sapiens ancestors. It mainly focuses on the motives or driving forces that are behind the emergence of the first units of language. The latter are defined in this paper, as the first vocal signals that convey information and meanings that go far beyond the usual vocal repertoire of non-human primates. They emerged as a consequence to make a sense to the principle of fairness by probing equal amounts of quantities in the context of food sharing operations after a collaborative labor. Early hominins realized that learning how to make equal food quantities, which should be regarded today as the most fundamental level for doing mathematics, is a prerequisite for the sustainability of collaborative labor (cooperation). This ancestral computing innovation is shown in this paper to be the greatest achievement of evolution in the Homo lineage. By developing the first computational capabilities, early hominins passed successfully the transition that allowed them to move from the instinct driven behavior, which prevails in the animal realm, to reasoning guided behavior in which processing information and language are two fundamental consequences.

JOUR ,,,,,"Educational designers are working to embed computation in required classes outside of computer science (CS) courses, to promote equitable access for all students. While many studies embed computation in one discipline, few include projects that substantively involve many disciplines. We conducted a mixed methods case study with a sequential design to explore adolescents’ self-efficacy and engagement in computational practices, along with practices in several disciplines of science and engineering. In partnership with two eighth-grade environmental science teachers in a culturally and linguistically diverse urban-ring city of the Northeast US, students (N = 199) worked in teams to design, assemble, and code for “smart”, or automated, miniature greenhouses. We report on successes in engagement, along with tensions in self-efficacy, namely relating to generality, social factors, and emotive sources. Specifically, we elaborate on tensions related to (1) engagement via fun and camaraderie vs. disaffection per anxiety and stress; (2) practices as sequential vs. simultaneous; (3) prior experience with coding vs. present application; and (4) disciplinary pre-conceptions vs. expansion. We conclude with implications for educational design of pluridisciplinary spaces, especially for those including computation, and which seek to leverage interest and engagement to develop self-efficacy. Also, we discuss how our study extends self-efficacy theory through its finer-grained analyses with more diverse participants. Ultimately, our work builds on and extends current educational designs for embedding computational practices in required, non-CS classes, a vital concern for adolescents’ present and future civic participation, in personal, social, and professional ways.

JOUR ,,,,,"In our interconnected world, Systems Thinking (ST) is increasingly being recognized as a key learning goal for science education to help students make sense of complex phenomena. To support students in mastering ST, educators are advocating for using computational modeling programs. However, studies suggest that students often have challenges with using ST in the context of computational modeling. While previous studies have suggested that students have challenges modeling change over time through collector and flow structures and representing iterative processes through feedback loops, most of these studies investigated student ST through pre and post tests or through interviews. As such there is a gap in the literature regarding how student ST approaches develop and change throughout a computational modeling unit. In this case study, we aimed to determine which aspects of ST students found challenging during a computational modeling unit, how their approaches to ST changed over time, and how the learning environment was supporting students with ST. Building on prior frameworks, we developed a seven-category analysis tool that enabled us to use a mixture of student discourse, writing, and screen actions to categorize seven ST behaviors in real time. Through using this semi-quantitative tool and subsequent narrative analysis, we found evidence for all seven behavior categories, but not all categories were equally represented. Meanwhile our results suggest that opportunities for students to engage in discourse with both their peers and their teacher supported them with ST. Overall, this study demonstrates how student discourse and student writing can be important evidence of ST and serve as a potential factor to evaluate ST application as part of students’ learning progression. The case study also provides evidence for the positive impact that the implementation of a social constructivist approach has in the context of constructing computational system models.

JOUR ,,,,,"A person’s personality comprises a range of behaviours, attitudes, and emotional patterns that shift throughout time due to ecological and biological influences. Personality prediction from the MBTI dataset poses computational efficiency, memory utilisation, and class imbalance challenges. This study proposes a novel approach leveraging Knowledge Distillation-based BERT to address these challenges. The process involves three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, data is cleaned by removing irrelevant characters and URLs, followed by tokenisation and conversion to lowercase for consistency. The padding ensures uniform input size for DistilBERT, with attention masks aiding focus on relevant tokens. DistilBERT extracts contextual embeddings, enhanced by segment and positional embeddings, capturing semantic meaning via multi-head self-attention. A fully connected layer with GELU activation and batch normalisation mitigates overfitting, followed by a classification layer with Sparsemax activation, addressing the class imbalance. Fine-tuning pre-trained DistilBERT maximises detection accuracy while excluding irrelevant learning objectives. Dynamic masking during inference replaces static masking, and the Radam optimiser optimises hyperparameters for improved convergence. Our approach offers a robust solution that achieves 93% accuracy and 95% F1-score for accurate personality prediction while mitigating computational complexities and class imbalance issues.

We used behavioral measures and computational modeling to identify whether participants learned to categorize using exemplar or prototype categorization representations. Correct/incorrect feedback resulted in greater use of exemplar representations and better performance by participants who used exemplar representations, whereas in comparison, rewarded point-valued feedback resulted in relatively greater use of prototype representations. These results indicate that differential reward increased abstraction during category learning.

JOUR ,,,,,"Cognitive impairment in psychosis is one of the strongest predictors of functional decline. Problems with decision-making processes, such as goal-directed action and reversal learning, can reflect cortico-striatal dysfunction. The heterogenous symptoms and neurobiology observed in those with psychosis suggests that specific cognitive phenotypes may reflect differing causative mechanisms. As such, decision-making performance could identify subgroups of individuals with more severe cortico-striatal dysfunction and help to predict their functional decline. The present work evaluated the relationship between goal-directed action, reversal learning, and symptom profiles in those with psychosis. We assessed decision-making processes in healthy controls (N = 34) and those with persistent psychosis (N = 45), subclassifying subjects based on intact/impaired goal-directed action. Compared with healthy controls (<20%), a large proportion (58%) of those with persistent psychosis displayed impaired goal-directed action, predicting poor serial reversal learning performance. Computational approaches indicated that those with impaired goal-directed action had a decreased capacity to rapidly update their prior beliefs in the face of changing contingencies. Impaired decision-making also was associated with reduced levels of grandiosity and increased problems with abstract thinking. These findings suggest that prominent decision-making deficits, indicative of cortico-striatal dysfunction, are present in a large proportion of people with persistent psychosis. Moreover, these impairments would have significant functional implications in terms of planning and abstract thinking. ",,,"Kesby, James P.

JOUR ,,,,,"Recent computational psychiatric research has dissected decision-making under risk into different underlying cognitive computational constructs and identified disease-specific changes in these constructs. Studies are underway to investigate what kind of behavioral or psychological interventions can restore these cognitive, computational constructs. In our previous study, we showed that reminiscing about positive autobiographical memories reduced risk aversion and affected probability weighting in the opposite direction from that observed in psychiatric disorders. However, in that study, we compared positive versus neutral memory retrieval by using a within-subjects crossover posttest design. Therefore, the change of decision-making from baseline is unclear. Furthermore, we used a hypothetical decision-making task and did not include monetary incentives. We attempt to address these limitations and investigated how reminiscing about positive autobiographical memories influences decision-making under risk using a between-subjects pretest posttest comparison design with performance-contingent monetary incentives. In thirty-eight healthy, young adults, we found that reminiscing about positive memories reinforced the commonly observed inverted S-shaped nonlinear probability weighting (f = 0.345, medium to large in effect size). In contrast, reminiscing about positive memories did not affect risk aversion in general. Given that the change in probability weighting after reminiscing about positive memories is in the opposite direction from that observed in psychiatric disorders, our results indicate that positive autobiographical memory retrieval might be a useful behavioral intervention strategy for amending the altered decision-making under risk in psychiatric diseases.

To address this, we developed a paradigm to elicit idiographic worries and ruminations during an fMRI scan in 39 young adults with a range of trait RNT scores. We measured concurrent emotion ratings and heart rate as a physiological metric of arousal. Multivariate representational similarity analysis revealed that regions distributed across default mode, salience, and frontoparietal control networks encode worry and rumination similarly. Moreover, heart rate did not differ between worry and rumination. Capturing the shared neural features between worry and rumination throughout networks supporting self-referential processing, memory, salience detection, and cognitive control provides novel empirical evidence to bolster cognitive and clinical models of RNT.

JOUR ,,,,,"One of the most unique and impressive feats of the human mind is its ability to discover and continuously refine its own cognitive strategies. Elucidating the underlying learning and adaptation mechanisms is very difficult because changes in cognitive strategies are not directly observable. One important domain in which strategies and mechanisms are studied is planning. To enable researchers to uncover how people learn how to plan, we offer a tutorial introduction to a recently developed process-tracing paradigm along with a new computational method for measuring the nature and development of a person’s planning strategies from the resulting process-tracing data. Our method allows researchers to reveal experience-driven changes in people’s choice of individual planning operations, planning strategies, strategy types, and the relative contributions of different decision systems. We validate our method on simulated and empirical data. On simulated data, its inferences about the strategies and the relative influence of different decision systems are accurate. When evaluated on human data generated using our process-tracing paradigm, our computational method correctly detects the plasticity-enhancing effect of feedback and the effect of the structure of the environment on people’s planning strategies. Together, these methods can be used to investigate the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity and to elucidate how people acquire complex cognitive skills such as planning and problem-solving. Importantly, our methods can also be used to measure individual differences in cognitive plasticity and examine how different types (pedagogical) interventions affect the acquisition of cognitive skills.

Study 1 demonstrated that the latent model-rated originality factor, comprised of three transformer-based models, strongly predicted human originality ratings, and the model-rated flexibility strongly correlated with human flexibility ratings as well. Criterion validity analyses indicated that model-rated originality and flexibility positively correlated to other creativity measures, demonstrating similar validity to human ratings.

Thus, the purpose of the research is to analyse, quantitatively and qualitatively, the impact of AI components and computational sciences on student performance. For this purpose, a systematic review and meta-analysis have been carried out in WOS and Scopus databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the sample was set at 25 articles. The results support the positive impact that AI and computational sciences have on student performance, finding a rise in their attitude towards learning and their motivation, especially in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas. Despite the multiple benefits provided, the implementation of these technologies in instructional processes involves a great educational and ethical challenge for teachers in relation to their design and implementation, which requires further analysis from the educational research. These findings are consistent at all educational stages. ",,,"León, Samuel P.
