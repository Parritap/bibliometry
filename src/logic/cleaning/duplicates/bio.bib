abstract = {Networks, as a representation of biological systems, provide an integral view point to systems biology. By representing biological interactions and phenomena as networks, insights about biology can be achieved by analyzing the networks. Visualization of networks opens up avenues to exploration, idea and hypothesis generation, and communication of results that cannot be done when representing networks in textual form or as abstract data structures. Network visualization is thus critical to interpret and dissemination of results in systems biology, yet fraught with technical and design challenges. In this review we give an overview of the current state of the art of network visualization techniques and tools in systems biology for static as well as interactive visualization of networks. We identify an emerging need for visualization of hierarchical network structure, a migration of network visualization tools towards the web and an opportunity to apply ideas for network visualization from other scientific domains to systems biology.}
