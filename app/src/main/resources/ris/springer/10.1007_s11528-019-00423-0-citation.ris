AB  - Researchers and educators have advocated computational thinking (CT) should be integrated into K-12 settings as early as elementary schools. However, there has been a lack of knowledge of how pre-service K-8 teachers would be engaged in the learning of CT and its integration in different subject areas. In this study, we taught a flipped learning module in an undergraduate Educational Technology course. Pre-service teachers learned and practiced CT knowledge and skills using a block programming app called Hopscotch. Results of this first iteration of design-based research showed that the orchestration of the technology and instructional methods, such as team-based learning, flipped classroom, and pair programming, supported studentsâ€™ transformative learning experience. It improved their understanding and application of CT concepts. Meanwhile, the mixed-method analysis found some instructional issues that needed to be addressed in future iterations. Suggestions were provided at the end of the paper.
