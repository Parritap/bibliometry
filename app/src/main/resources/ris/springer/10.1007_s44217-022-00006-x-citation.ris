AB  - The present study explores teachers' conception and reflection of computer programming with a Scratch in terms of technological and pedagogical aspects.  A mixed research approach specifically sequential explanatory research design was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The population was comprised of two hundred and four in-service Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology teachers from Kayonza district, Rwanda. However, only 34 were randomly selected to participate in the study. An achievement test and structured interview were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The quantitative data obtained from pre- and post-tests were analyzed using a paired t test, and the data from the interview was analyzed by descriptive, and interpretive analyses. It was revealed that secondary school teachers have a respectable conception and constructive reflection of Scratch programming once attending scratch training. Quantitative findings showed that there was an important difference in the mean among pre- and post-tests with 0.171 learning gain and an effect size of 0.53 (df = 33, p < 0.05). It was also revealed that Scratch is an operational instructional tool for teaching and learning Mathematics and Sciences. Furthermore, teachers articulated progressive views of using scratch in teaching and learning Mathematics and Sciences as it supports them to visualize abstract content, improves students' interest and impetus, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, and acts as an assessment tool.
