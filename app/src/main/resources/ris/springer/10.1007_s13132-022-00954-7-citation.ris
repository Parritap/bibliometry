AB  - Designers across the globe are facing challenges to incorporate cultural elements in design process. There is limited research from design perspective that focuses on integrating culture in design thinking. The literature review carried on for this study indicates that there is very less systemic approach to identify and assimilate the cultural elements in design process. Thus, the aim of this study is to construct a model for cultural-specific design based on basic units of cultures, i.e., memes. The model mainly consists of three phases: identification of cultural units, evaluation as memes and incorporation in design thinking process. The constructed model provides a new way of understanding usersâ€™ need for developing culture-specific design.
