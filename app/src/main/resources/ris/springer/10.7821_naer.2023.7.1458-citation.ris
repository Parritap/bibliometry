AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are transforming the approach to education. In particular, ChatGPT’s potential to process large amounts of data and learn from user interactions makes it a beneficial resource for students, albeit with some reluctance from some teachers. This study aimed to explore the acceptance of ChatGPT by university students. The researchers administered an online survey to 400 Spanish university students aged 18–64 (M = 21.80; SD = 6.40). The results of the methodological approach based on the UTAUT2 model for technology adoption showed that: 1) gender was not a determining variable in any construct while the experience of use was a factor conditioning a higher score on all constructs; 2) experience, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit were influential in behavioral intention to use ChatGPT; 3) facilitating conditions, habit, and behavioral intention were conditioning factors in user behavior. Finally, this report discusses the findings and practical implications of the work and recommends some good uses for ChatGPT.
